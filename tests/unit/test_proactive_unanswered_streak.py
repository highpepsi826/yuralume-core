"""Consecutive-unanswered proactive streak — the anti-跳針 fact layer.

Covers the two collaborating pieces:

* ``_count_unanswered_streak`` (dispatcher) — how many leading SENT
  pushes the user has not replied to, using the same "replied iff the
  user spoke after the push" test as the prompt reply tags.
* ``render_unanswered_streak_lines`` (shared prompt helper) — only
  surfaces the escalation-licence block once the run is worth reacting
  to as its own fact.
