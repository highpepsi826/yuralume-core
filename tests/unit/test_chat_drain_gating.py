"""Chat turns under a draining replica (GD1-A).

``HOSTED_PROMPT_PACK_DISTRIBUTION_PLAN`` §7.1 lists what a mid-turn SIGKILL
costs: a 502 for the player, a conversation locked until the 180s lease TTL, and
credits reserved until the stale-reservation sweeper finds them. GD1 buys the
deploy a window in which none of that has to happen, and that window rests on
exactly two promises this file pins:

* a turn that *starts* on a draining replica costs nothing — refused before the
  charge, before the lease, before a single row is written. It is the
  belt-and-suspenders half (the router has already stopped routing here), so the
  bar is "leaves no trace", not "handled gracefully";
* a turn already *running* is untouched by the drain and is still counted while
  it runs. ``active_turns`` is what ``deploy.sh`` polls to zero before it
  recreates the container, so a count that under-reported would hand the deploy
  permission to kill live work — which is precisely the bug GD exists to fix.

The exception and abandoned-stream paths get their own tests because those are
the ones a ``finally`` is easy to get wrong on, and a leaked count does not fail
loudly: it silently spends the deploy's entire 180s budget.
