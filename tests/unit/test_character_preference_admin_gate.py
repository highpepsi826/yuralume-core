"""Admin gate on per-character routing-preference writes.

Post-immersion product decision: LLM / image / video ROUTING is
admin-only. Per-character routing pins (``feature-models`` /
``image-profiles`` / ``video-profiles``) were previously gated only by
character ownership — any player could pin routing on their own
characters and bypass the admin-owned global routes. These tests lock
the write path behind ``require_admin`` while keeping GET open to the
owner.

Harness mirrors ``tests/integration/test_character_ownership_routes.py``
(auth enabled + in-memory DB) so we can express a genuine non-admin
caller — the auth-disabled unit harness only ever runs as the implied
admin default operator.
