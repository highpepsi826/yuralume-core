"""Self-continuing chain: a handled kind runs its step and enqueues its next occurrence.

Also the end-to-end reconcile → claim → handle → next-chain flow against the in-memory
queue (the fast twin of the §14 PostgreSQL integration): seed a character, drive a fake
worker, and assert the chain self-continues with the right due; freeze stops it; thaw +
reconcile relinks it.
