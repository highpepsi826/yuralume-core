"""消費者政策軸釘住測試（CD0 驗收紅線）.

``test_character_backup_registry.py`` pins *what a character's data is*.
This suite pins *what each consumer does with it*, with the same
mechanism CB0 used — introspect the real artefacts (ORM metadata, the
export service's own source) rather than trusting a plan document:

1. **Every consumer has a stance on every registered table.** Resolution
   is total or the suite is red; there is no silent fallback. Deleting
   any single declaration — a table override, a classification default,
   a reset flag entry — turns something below red.

2. **"Rows survive" always carries a reason.** ``RETAIN`` / ``SKIP`` /
   ``CLEAR_REFERENCE`` are the stances a future reader is most likely to
   mistake for an oversight, so an empty reason is a failure.

3. **Reset is description, not design.** The declared flag → table sets
   are checked against the schema facts they claim (FK ``ondelete``
   modes), so a migration that changes a cascade turns this red instead
   of silently widening what "clear the chat log" means.

4. **The media harvest surface cannot drift from the exporter.** The
   registry's media-URL field list is compared **both ways** against the
   AST of ``CharacterBackupExportService._observe_record``.
