"""Regression lock for LocalMessagingProactiveDeliveryAdapter (LH4, §8.3).

Verifies the extracted self-host external sink behaves byte-identically to the
dispatcher's former inline ``_deliver``: the fake platform adapter receives the
same segmented ``OutboundMessage`` (text / credentials / locale / attachments /
empty reply_context), the ``source=<platform>`` conversation is self-healed and
the assistant turn appended, the binding gains its conversation id, and the
acceptance carries the binding id so the dispatcher can keep stamping it.
