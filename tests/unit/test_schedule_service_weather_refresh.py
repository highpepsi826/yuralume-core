"""ScheduleService weather freshness / re-plan behaviour.

Regression coverage for the "放晴後角色還在說下雨" bug. Two seams:

1. **Future-day pre-plans carry no weather.** The Open-Meteo adapter only
   knows *today's* weather (``forecast_days=1``), so injecting it into a
   day that is not the current local day froze "today rained" into
   tomorrow's plan. ``ensure_schedule`` must hand the planner an empty
   weather block for any ``target`` that is not the current local day.

2. **A "today" schedule pre-planned on an earlier day is re-planned.**
   When the day a forecast was made for finally arrives, the plan must be
   regenerated with that day's real weather instead of short-circuiting on
   the stale row — but only while it is safe (nothing memorialised yet),
   so the re-plan never duplicates already-recorded memories.
