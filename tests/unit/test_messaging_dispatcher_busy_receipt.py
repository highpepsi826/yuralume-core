"""A busy conversation must never consume an inbound delivery.

Two guards landed independently and interact badly:

* the durable ``InboundReceiptPort`` claim at the top of ``handle_inbound``
  (a delivery is claimed on *attempt*, and a claimed delivery is dropped for
  the next 7 days), and
* the per-conversation chat turn lease, which raises
  ``ConversationBusyError`` when a sibling turn is in flight.

A player who sends two messages quickly therefore claimed the receipt for
message #2, hit the lease, fell into the dispatcher catch-all — and message #2
was gone for good, because every platform re-delivery was suppressed by the
receipt it had already burned. Losing a player's message is worse than
answering twice, so ``ConversationBusyError`` gets its own path: give the claim
(and the in-process debounce stamp) back, then let the transport re-deliver.

The non-busy catch-all deliberately keeps the opposite semantics — see
``test_non_busy_failure_keeps_the_receipt``.
