    ``None`` means "leave alone" for both ``display_name`` and
    ``pronouns``; pass an empty string in the future if we want to
    distinguish "clear" — for now empty strings are also "leave alone"
    since the caller almost always wants to keep at least a name.
    ``aliases=None`` leaves the list alone; an empty list clears it.

    ``current_status`` is retired (PP series — superseded by the
    per-character ``player_persona_note``). The field stays declared here,
    accepted and silently dropped rather than removed, because an
    already-deployed self-hosted frontend still sends it on every save;
    dropping the field from the model would make pydantic's default
    ``extra="ignore"`` do the same thing implicitly, which is fragile if
    that default ever changes. Nothing reads this value past the route —
    see ``update_operator_profile``.

    They ride along so the settings UI can explain a switch that has no effect
    (a tier that never opened overage) and state the ceiling in the same
    disclosure that asks for consent.

    The two prices are this player's tier's current price for one purchase, and
    ``None`` when it cannot be stated — which is also the signal that the switch
    cannot be turned on at all right now, since consent is to a number. The UI
    disables the control and says so rather than letting the player discover it
