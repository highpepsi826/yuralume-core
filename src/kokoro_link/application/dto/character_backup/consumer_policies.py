"""角色資料邊界的**消費者政策軸**（CD0，ROADMAP #35）.

``registry.py`` answers *what a character's data is*. This module
answers *what each consumer does with it* — so the boundary stops being
"the backup exporter's private list" and becomes one fact four call
sites resolve against:

===========  ====================================================
consumer     what the policy decides
===========  ====================================================
``BACKUP``   travels in ``.lumebackup`` or not (identity mapping:
             the §3 classification already *is* the policy)
``DELETE``   ``delete_character`` purges / retains / leaves alone
``RESET``    which flag of ``reset_character_data`` clears what
``LUMECARD`` documentary only — column-level subset of A-layer
             ``characters``, no table axis of its own
===========  ====================================================

**Shape: default-per-classification + per-table override.** A flat
``N consumers × 60+ tables`` matrix would be unreadable and would rot
row by row; declaring the default at the classification level means a
newly registered table inherits a defensible stance the moment CB0's pin
test forces it to pick a classification, and only the genuinely
irregular tables spend an override (each of which must carry its own
``reason``).

**Resolution is total and fails loud.** :func:`policy_for` raises
:class:`UnresolvedPolicyError` when a table has neither an override nor
a classification default. That is deliberate for
``EXCLUDE_CROSS_OR_DEPLOYMENT``, which has **no** delete default: every
cross-character / deployment-bound table has to state its own stance,
because "what happens to the other side's row" is never a question one
default can answer. Deleting an override there turns the pin test red
rather than silently falling back.

Nothing here executes. It is a declaration the consumers will be wired
to; CD0 lands the declaration plus its pin test only.
