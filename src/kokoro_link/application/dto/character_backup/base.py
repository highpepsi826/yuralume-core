"""Shared base for ``.lumebackup`` per-table DTOs (CB0).

Every DTO in this package is a row-level projection of exactly one ORM
table: **field names match column names one-to-one** (the registry pin
test enforces ``dto fields == table columns − excluded columns``), and
values are the portable form of the column value —

- ``datetime`` / ``date`` fields stay typed; the JSONL boundary uses
  pydantic's JSON serialization (ISO 8601) and parsing, so in-process
  code keeps real datetimes while the archive carries strings,
- JSON-in-Text columns (``*_json``, ``tags``, ``world_frames``, …) are
  carried verbatim as their raw string — the backup does not re-parse
  content it doesn't own.

Version tolerance (plan §4): the archive-level gate rejects a
``BACKUP_SCHEMA_VERSION`` newer than this build; *older* archives are
tolerated by pydantic defaults — every field added after v1 must ship
with a default, and unknown fields from same-major drift are ignored
(``extra="ignore"``).
