class CharacterBackupRecord(BackupRecord):
    """The character master row, minus the columns the registry excludes.

    Excluded (see ``registry.py`` for the per-column reasons):

    - B-layer deployment routing — ``voice_profile_json``,
      ``loras_json``, ``feature_models_json``,
      ``feature_image_profiles_json``, ``feature_video_profiles_json``:
      they point at providers / profiles / LoRA files the target
      instance does not have (`.lumecard` draws the same line).
    - Deployment / runtime mechanics — ``subscription_locked`` (a
      projection of the exporting deployment's Cloud tenant lock) and
      ``last_consolidated_at`` (a cross-replica claim stamp).
    - Cross-instance provenance — ``origin_official_card_id``: the
      cloud-exclusive card it names is a Cloud record, so a restore
      elsewhere would either dangle or, worse, mint a "managed"
      character with no licence behind it. A restored character is
      always an ordinary one.

    ``id`` is the *original* character id: restore reissues every id
    (D4) and uses this value only as the remap key; ``user_id`` and
    ``image_urls`` are likewise remapped / rewritten on import.
    ``frozen`` / ``frozen_at`` / ``frozen_reason`` ARE carried — a
    deliberately frozen character should come back frozen.
