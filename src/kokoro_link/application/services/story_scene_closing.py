"""Wrapping a 起幕 scene up and landing it as canon (SC1-D).

Three routes reach this module and all three run the same steps in the
same order — the verdict after an in-scene turn, the player's 「結束場景」
button, and (SC1-E) the idle-timeout sweep. Sharing the core is not
tidiness: the red line that a wrap-up must never invent player actions
 is only as strong as its weakest path, and the
timeout path — the one nobody is watching — is exactly where a second
implementation would drift.

The order of the steps is the design:

1. **Write first, close second.** The wrap-up is generated before the
   session row is touched, so a replica that loses the close race throws
   away prose instead of leaving a closed scene it never got to narrate.
2. **The close is a compare-and-set.** Losing it is an ordinary outcome
   (someone else wrapped this scene up) and returns idempotently — no
   second narration in the thread, no second beat realization.
3. **Everything after the close is fail-soft.** Once the row says
   ``closed`` the player is unstuck, which is the wrap-up's actual
   obligation; a thread append or a canon write that fails afterwards is
   logged and lived with, never rolled back into a re-opened scene.

**When the writer produces nothing** the scene still closes — that is the
point of step 3 — and canon falls back to the one piece of prose about
this scene that is already known to be real and known to contain no
player actions: its own opening narration, still sitting in the thread.
That is a deliberately lossy record, not a fabricated one. Landing
nothing at all was the alternative and it is worse: the beat would stay
pending, and the next 起幕 would re-enact a scene the player can still
read further up the same thread.
