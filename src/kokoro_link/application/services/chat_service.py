"""Chat application service.

Coordinates character, conversation, memory, goal, and model ports to
handle both synchronous and streaming chat replies. Memory retrieval
uses ``MemoryRanker`` to pick prompt-ready items; post-turn processing
delegates to ``PostTurnProcessorPort`` for combined memory extraction,
LLM-based state refinement, and short-term intent updates. Every
``goal_review_interval`` turns, ``GoalReviewerPort`` is asked to advance
the character's medium-term goals.

    (no images, drop-placeholder prompt) can be swapped in transparently

    ``capture`` is always the one that actually produced the stream (the
    retry's, when a degrade happened), preserving the metadata contract.

    Returns ``(stream, capture, sent_prompt)``. ``sent_prompt`` is the

    drop placeholder after a degrade retry — so trace construction
    records what the model really saw, not the pre-degrade prompt.

    the conversation id is only known once ``_load_conversation`` has run, and

           scene still open?") doubles as the liveness check for
           everything below — the common path costs one write and no
           extra read.
        2. **The verdict and the chips run together.** Both are model
           calls inside the conversation's turn lease, and they answer
           two questions about the same moment ("is the scene over?" /
           "what could the player do next?"), so running them serially
           would double the tail latency of every in-scene turn to buy
           nothing. The chips are simply discarded on the rare turn whose
           verdict ends the scene.
        3. **A resolved verdict wins.** The scene closed, so there is no
           "next move" to suggest and the reply carries the wrap-up
           instead of chips.

        ``chips=False`` keeps the stamp and the verdict and skips the
        suggestion: an external channel (LINE) plays the scene for real,
        so its turns must keep the scene alive *and* must be able to end
        it, but it has no chip surface and that call would be a model
        round-trip nobody could ever tap.

        The distributed worker calls this after claiming a ``post_turn`` job. It

        job is enqueued) to rebuild ``user_text`` / ``assistant_text`` /
        ``prior_messages``, re-verifies the character (§3.3: existence + frozen /
        subscription gate), then delegates to the SAME ``_do_post_turn`` body the
        embedded in-process path uses (抽共用而非複製 — zero behaviour fork).

        **Anchor**: the assistant message's positional index in the conversation.
        Conversations are append-only, so a concurrent later turn only appends at the
        end and never shifts an earlier index — a stale slice-by-last-message would
        instead pick up a NEWER turn's text. The prior-dialogue window is rebuilt from
        the cross-source ``recent_messages_for_character`` cut at the turn's user
        message instant, reproducing the pre-turn window the write point captured.

        **Rerun safety**: ``_do_post_turn`` is fail-soft (it swallows each side
        effect's error and returns), so a handled error never fails the job into a
        retry. The only rerun is a hard worker crash mid-body → reclaim; memory writes
        self-dedup by content, but additive emotion-event / promise / schedule writes

    """How much of ``max_messages_per_session`` this thread has consumed.

    Counted on the **character's side**, one per reply it produced. That is
    the only measure the two shapes of a turn share: an ordinary turn is
    user + assistant, but a silent 示意 (SN1) is assistant *alone*, so the
    pre-SN1 count of *user* messages would have let a capped account pull an
    unbounded number of replies by never typing anything. The knob is a
    per-tier control-plane setting, so any tier that sets it is exposed to
    that hole — it is not tied to any one tier.

    Consequences worth naming, both accepted rather than overlooked:

    - A proactive message the character sent on its own now consumes a slot
      too. It is the same LLM reply and the same money, and no marker on a
      persisted message distinguishes it from a nudge reply — adding one
      would mean a new ``MessageKind`` on the player's thread, which the SN
      plan rules out. The direction is the safe one for a spend ceiling.
    - Scene narration is excluded so that opening a 起幕 scene (narration +
      the character's first line) costs one slot rather than two; the
      narration is the frame, not the character speaking, and scene
      openings already have their own daily ceiling.
