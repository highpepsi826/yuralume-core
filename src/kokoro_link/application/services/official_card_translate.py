"""Ops-time translation of an official character card's catalog content.

The Cloud control plane owns the official-card catalog: the ``.lumecard``
artifact, the per-locale translation rows, the approval state. What it
does **not** own is how card prose is translated — the field policy, the
merge validation and the "never invent, never blank" discipline live in
:mod:`kokoro_link.infrastructure.character_card.llm_translator`, because
that is what the player-facing import path has always used. Reimplementing
them in Java would be a second source of truth that drifts on the first
new profile field (plan §3.4 / D4).

So this module is the seam: a **stateless** text transformer the console
calls, holding nothing and reading nothing.

Two disciplines carried over verbatim from the import translator:

* **Same-length or nothing** for list fields — a shorter list pairs item 2
  with item 3's translation, and no caller can tell which item vanished.
* **Never blank the source** — a field the model dropped, emptied or
  answered with a non-string keeps its original text.

One discipline is new, and it is why this is a separate service rather
than a call into ``translate_profile``: **failure is per field, not per
card**. The console shows the owner exactly which fields came back
untranslated so they can retry those; a whole-card 502 would turn one
stubborn ``note`` field into "the card cannot be translated".

The prompt is inline here rather than in the baseline prompt pack for the
same reason the showcase reviewer's is (SH ruling): an ops tool must not
acquire a dependency on the pack release order — a Core deploy that lands
before the pack would otherwise break the console's button.

personality-type prose. Structural values that must not be translated have
already been removed.

Rules:
- Translate every field present in the input.
- Output a JSON object with exactly the same keys. Do not add or drop keys.
- For array fields keep the same item count and order.
- `title`, `description`, `tags` and `note` are catalog copy: keep them the
  same length class as the source, do not turn them into marketing prose,
  do not add information the source does not state.
- Names should be natural in the target language: transliterate or localize
- Keep the companion count and order unchanged, and keep every companion's
  keys and list item counts unchanged.
  when appropriate, and leave them as-is when already suitable.
- Pronouns should be natural pronouns in the target language, not literal
  word-by-word output.
- If a value is already in the target language, keep it unchanged.
- Do not add explanations, markdown, comments, or fields that were not in
  the input.
- Output valid JSON only.
