"""Orchestration: roll seeds → expand via LLM → persist + memorialise.

The entry point is :meth:`StoryEventService.ensure_today` — idempotent,
called lazily by the chat path on every turn (same pattern as
``ScheduleService.ensure_schedule``). On the first call of a civil day,
it rolls, expands, persists, and fires a matching episodic memory. On
subsequent calls the same day it's a no-op because the roll finds
today's seed already picked.

**Arc integration**: when a ``StoryArcService`` is wired, ``ensure_today``
first checks whether the character's active arc has a beat due today.
If yes, the beat wins the daily slot but is **not** immediately expanded
into a diary entry. Instead it records a play attempt so prompt builders
can stage the scene and post-turn can later persist the actual performed
moment as a ``StoryEvent``. Background callers pass ``unattended=True``
so a beat that is *about the player* is left waiting instead of being
performed with nobody in the room (see :meth:`ensure_today`).

           today (or an overdue pending beat), surface **that** as
           today's playable scene and do not roll gacha. Arc beats
           always win the daily slot so the narrative spine doesn't get
           hijacked by a random diary entry.
        2. Otherwise fall back to the gacha. A day with no arc beat is
           free narrative territory — the gacha fills the gap so the
           character still has **something** happening.

        ``unattended`` says **who is asking**, and it exists because this
        method has two kinds of caller. The chat turn is *attended*: a
        player is in the room, the due beat is about to be handed to the
        prompt builder as today's scene directive, and recording that it
        was surfaced is a true fact. A background tick (the proactive
        dispatcher, character warm-up) is *unattended*: nothing it does
        here reaches a player, so a beat whose ``operator_position`` is
        ``central`` is passed over — no play attempt, no recheck, and
        therefore no ``mark_realized`` (
        red line 4). Without the flag, background ticks alone push such a
        beat past the recheck threshold and the rechecker quietly writes
        the scene into canon — a scene that only exists *because* the
        player is in it, performed while they were away.

        Same vocabulary and same default as
        ``StoryArcService.next_beat_due(unattended=...)``: the player
        surfaces never pass it, so opting *out* of the fix is impossible
        by omission, and a caller that forgets it keeps today's
        behaviour rather than inheriting a silently different one.

    - ``present`` / ``central`` return a single operator
      :class:`ParticipantRef`, reusing the position string itself as
      ``role``. The beat's own OP0-A vocabulary already names the
      distinction the memory needs, so inventing a second label for
      the same fact would be a translation with nothing to translate.
      ``actor_id=None`` / ``display_name="使用者"`` mirrors the existing
      operator-ParticipantRef convention used for schedule involvement
      (``schedule_service._with_operator_involvement``) and social
      knowledge (``llm_planner._operator_participant_refs``) — this is
      a single-operator system, so there is no id to carry.

    Deliberately blind to ``operator_note``: that field is prose for
    writer prompts, not a structural fact, and folding free text into
    stored provenance here would let narrative material silently steer
    what a memory claims about who was present.

    This is a one-way projection only (plan red line 3): it reads
    ``StoryArcBeat.operator_position`` and never touches
    ``ScheduleActivity``/``ParticipantRef`` roles that carry schedule's
    own invitation-lifecycle vocabulary (``operator_confirmed_shared``
    et al.) — different semantics, so they stay on their own values.
