"""Character backup export orchestration (CB2).

The full pipeline behind ``POST /characters/{id}/backup``:

1. **Request time (password-touching, synchronous)** — ownership check,
   the managed-character gate (EC3 — a managed character's persona
   lives only on the server, so no backup for it may ever exist;
   ``CharacterBackupManagedError``), per-character in-flight dedup,
   hosted rate limit, then
   :func:`~kokoro_link.infrastructure.security.backup_cipher.prepare_envelope`
   (scrypt KDF + file-key wrap). The job row stores only the envelope
   header and the raw file key; **the password itself never reaches the
   job, the database, or a log line** (plan §5/§9 red line).
2. **Background job** — dump every CARRY table to ``data/<table>.jsonl``
   through the CB0 registry + read-only export reader, reverse-look-up
   media originals from the freshly dumped rows (the DB is the only
   media index — object storage has no list-by-prefix), bundle the bound
   arc template / series YAML the same way ``.lumecard`` does, write the
   manifest (counts / NSFW collapse stats / media inventory / fail-soft
   report), encrypt the zip with the prepared envelope material, and put
   the artifact under the ephemeral ``character-backups/`` prefix.
   The plaintext zip lives only in a job-local temp dir and is unlinked
   the moment encryption finishes — 即產即密即刪.
3. **Terminal transition** — ``finalize_scrubbed`` erases the key
   material in the same UPDATE that flips the status (CB0 semantic);
   the TTL backstop in :meth:`recover` catches crashed jobs.

Execution mirrors the Creator Studio job precedent (fusion/branching):
asyncio tasks in this process, a durable ledger row for restart
recovery, ``MAX_BACKUP_JOB_ATTEMPTS`` bounding crash loops.

**Known and accepted: the dump is not a single snapshot.** Each table is
streamed in its own session (``SACharacterBackupExportReader.stream_rows``
opens one per call), so an archive taken while the character is being
talked to can hold a later table referencing rows an earlier table was
dumped before. The sharpest instance is ``dialogue_checkpoints``, whose
``covers_until_message_key`` can name a message written after
``messages.jsonl`` was closed — a restored archive would then carry a
summary reaching past its own transcript. It is a whole-pipeline
property rather than that table's: fixing it there alone would buy a
guarantee the other carried tables do not keep. The real fix is one
repeatable-read transaction spanning the whole dump, which changes how
the export runs rather than what it exports.
