"""User-comment service for feed-wall posts.

Sits between the HTTP routes and three repos:

- ``FeedCommentRepositoryPort`` owns the row-per-comment storage.
- ``FeedPostRepositoryPort`` owns the denormalised
  ``FeedReactionSummary.comments`` snapshot — recounted after every
  add/remove so the list endpoint never has to JOIN.
- (Phase A3) memory writes will land here so the character can
  recall what the user said.

Authoring rules: a comment body is non-empty (entity-level) and the
service refuses to attach a comment to a missing post (404).
