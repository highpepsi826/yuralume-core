"""Pending follow-up dispatcher — tick-time release of deferred replies.

Runs from ``ProactiveScheduler._tick_all`` after the scheduler has
ensured today's schedule and (optionally) refreshed rest recovery, so
``ScheduleService.resolve_current`` returns the post-tick view of the
day.

Per-character flow:

1. Find queued ``PendingFollowUp`` rows whose ``scheduled_for`` has
   passed.
2. For each row, double-gate on the character's *current* busy_score —
   high busy means the LLM's original "I'll get back to you" promise
   still holds; we leave the row queued until the next tick.
3. Force-release at-cap rows regardless of busy_score (the user has
   already stacked up :data:`MAX_QUEUED_MESSAGES` follow-ups —
   continuing to defer makes the eventual reply unworkably long).
4. Mark the row ``resolving`` (so a crashing dispatcher mid-call can't
   be retried while a stale row sits in flight), call the LLM composer
   for the full reply, then call
   ``ProactiveDispatcher.deliver_pre_composed`` to fan out to web SSE +
   Telegram / LINE bindings — pinned to the binding resolved BEFORE the
   compose, because that resolution is also what decided whether the
   message may carry the player's own declaration.

   That compose goes through :class:`ComposerToolLoop` when one is
   wired (PF1), so a promise to *do* something — look a fact up, take a
   picture — actually runs the tool before the message is written, and
   ships whatever it produced as attachments on the same delivery. With
   no loop injected the step is the single plain ``compose`` it always
   was.
5. On success → ``resolved``; on any failure → flip back to ``queued``
   with ``last_error`` set so the next tick retries.

   With one exception (F1): a compose the HV1 honesty gate withheld does
   not flip back *still due*. An honesty park changes nothing about the
   row, so an immediate re-queue asks the same model the same question on
   the next tick — forever, if it is systematically dishonest — and,
   because ``list_due`` is ordered by ``scheduled_for`` and limited, the
   permanently-overdue row also holds the head of the queue against newer
   promises. So the release instant moves forward, and a park the *model*
   caused is charged against a per-row budget whose ceiling ends the row
   loudly instead of retrying it silently. A park caused by our own judge
   being unreachable is delayed but never charged — see
   :func:`_honesty_park_disposition`.

   The QG4 quality gate withholding a round takes the same "delayed, not
   charged" road (RC): its refusal also leaves the row unchanged, so the
   next tick would re-run the identical prompt and be refused identically
   — at two composes and two judge calls per tick, forever. It is only
   delayed and never given up on, because giving up needs a per-row
   attempt count and the only one that exists belongs to the honesty
   budget, whose exhaustion alarms about a lying model. See
   :data:`QUALITY_SKIP_RETRY_SECONDS`.

Failure isolation: every step is wrapped so a single bad row does not
break the loop. Other characters / other tick steps must keep working.

judge calls every time it is taken. Before this the release instant was
left in the past, so "every time" meant every tick, forever, for a
composer that could not write prose this judge would accept.

Note what this floor deliberately does **not** do: it never cancels the

        EVERY write this release makes after its compose goes through here,
        because every one of them was computed from a snapshot taken before
        it — and PF3 keeps two executors alive over the same row on purpose
        (the reconciler re-mints the text half every sweep while the image
        half waits for its slot), while the repository's ``save`` is a
        version-less upsert. A stale snapshot written back can therefore put
        a row the image half already resolved back on ``queued`` with its
        ``resolved_at`` / ``resolved_message`` erased: the message the player
        already has, recorded as never sent — and the next sweep composes and
        renders it all over again.

        ``still_ours`` is **per transition, and the asymmetry is deliberate**,
        because the claim that puts a row on ``resolving`` is itself a
        version-less upsert: two executors can both see ``resolving`` and
        neither can tell whose it is. So each write abandons on what would
        actually outrank the fact it carries:

        * :meth:`_mark_resolved` after a confirmed send —
          :func:`_a_delivery_write_is_still_ours`. Gives up only on a
          **terminal** status (``resolved`` / ``cancelled``): somebody else
          already filed a final answer for this promise and re-stamping it
          with our body would record the wrong sentence as the one the player
          received. ``queued`` does NOT stop it: that only means a concurrent
          executor pushed the row back for a retry, and "the message went out"
          is the stronger fact — leaving it queued is exactly the bug above,
          just entered through the other door.
        * :meth:`_fail_back_to_queued` and :meth:`_park_for_capability` —
          :func:`_a_retry_write_is_still_ours`. Gives up on anything but
          ``resolving``. All they carry is "this pass didn't finish", which
          has no strength to overwrite anyone's result; and if the row is
          already ``queued``, the retry they want is scheduled regardless.
        * :meth:`_park_empty_compose` and
          :meth:`_give_up_after_honesty_parks` — the same *retry* rule,
          the second one despite writing a terminal status. What it
          carries is "**our** composes kept being withheld", which is a
          statement about this executor's passes and nothing else; if a
          concurrent executor has meanwhile queued, resolved or cancelled
          the row, its answer is both newer and better informed, and

          budget the row may no longer have spent.

        forwarded when we actually have one: a ``None`` sink means the
        dispatcher never gave us a resolver to begin with, and such a
        stand-in has no ``target`` parameter to receive either.

        ``attachments`` carries whatever a tool produced while the
        promise was being fulfilled (a generated photo, typically) into
        the pre-composed delivery path that has always accepted them —
        the promise "晚點傳照片給你" is only kept if the photo ships

        genuine retry can re-claim (embedded stays byte-identical — its single
