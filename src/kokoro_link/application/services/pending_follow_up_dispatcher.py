"""Pending follow-up dispatcher — tick-time release of deferred replies.

Runs from ``ProactiveScheduler._tick_all`` after the scheduler has
ensured today's schedule and (optionally) refreshed rest recovery, so
``ScheduleService.resolve_current`` returns the post-tick view of the
day.

Per-character flow:

1. Find queued ``PendingFollowUp`` rows whose ``scheduled_for`` has
   passed.
2. For each row, double-gate on the character's *current* busy_score —
   high busy means the LLM's original "I'll get back to you" promise
   still holds; we leave the row queued until the next tick.
3. Force-release at-cap rows regardless of busy_score (the user has
   already stacked up :data:`MAX_QUEUED_MESSAGES` follow-ups —
   continuing to defer makes the eventual reply unworkably long).
4. Mark the row ``resolving`` (so a crashing dispatcher mid-call can't
   be retried while a stale row sits in flight), call the LLM composer
   for the full reply, then call
   ``ProactiveDispatcher.deliver_pre_composed`` to fan out to web SSE +
   Telegram / LINE bindings — pinned to the binding resolved BEFORE the
   compose, because that resolution is also what decided whether the
   message may carry the player's own declaration.

   That compose goes through :class:`ComposerToolLoop` when one is
   wired (PF1), so a promise to *do* something — look a fact up, take a
   picture — actually runs the tool before the message is written, and
   ships whatever it produced as attachments on the same delivery. With
   no loop injected the step is the single plain ``compose`` it always
   was.
5. On success → ``resolved``; on any failure → flip back to ``queued``
   with ``last_error`` set so the next tick retries.

Failure isolation: every step is wrapped so a single bad row does not
break the loop. Other characters / other tick steps must keep working.

        EVERY write this release makes after its compose goes through here,

        it — and PF3 keeps two executors alive over the same row on purpose
        (the reconciler re-mints the text half every sweep while the image
        half waits for its slot), while the repository's ``save`` is a
        version-less upsert. A stale snapshot written back can therefore put
        a row the image half already resolved back on ``queued`` with its
        ``resolved_at`` / ``resolved_message`` erased: the message the player
        already has, recorded as never sent — and the next sweep composes and
        renders it all over again.

        ``still_ours`` is **per transition, and the asymmetry is deliberate**,
        because the claim that puts a row on ``resolving`` is itself a
        version-less upsert: two executors can both see ``resolving`` and

          **terminal** status (``resolved`` / ``cancelled``): somebody else
          already filed a final answer for this promise and re-stamping it
          with our body would record the wrong sentence as the one the player
          received. ``queued`` does NOT stop it: that only means a concurrent
          executor pushed the row back for a retry, and "the message went out"
          is the stronger fact — leaving it queued is exactly the bug above,
          just entered through the other door.
        * :meth:`_fail_back_to_queued` and :meth:`_park_for_capability` —
          :func:`_a_retry_write_is_still_ours`. Gives up on anything but
          ``resolving``. All they carry is "this pass didn't finish", which
          has no strength to overwrite anyone's result; and if the row is
          already ``queued``, the retry they want is scheduled regardless.

        the promise "晚點傳照片給你" is only kept if the photo ships

        genuine retry can re-claim (embedded stays byte-identical — its single

        Asking twice — gate now, endpoint again after the compose — is the

        bump inside that window (the owner flipping ``accepts_proactive``,
        a ``with_conversation`` self-heal) re-orders the candidates. A
        multi-speaker group binding could therefore receive a message that
        was cleared, and written, for the owner's own DM.
