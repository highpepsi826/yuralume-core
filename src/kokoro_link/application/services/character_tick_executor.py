"""Per-character tick body — the '不分叉 domain service' (HOSTED_CORE_SCALING §13).

The embedded :class:`ProactiveScheduler` and the (future) distributed worker must
run the EXACT same per-character sequence. This executor owns that sequence so both
callers delegate to a single implementation. It is **stateless between calls**: every
cross-tick throttle / grace decision is made by the caller and handed in as
``allow_dispatch`` / ``beat_sink`` / ``gate``. The only side effect on shared mutable
state (the scheduler's event queue) is routed through ``beat_sink`` so the executor
never touches the queue itself.

Behaviour is byte-identical to the pre-extraction scheduler loop: same step order,
same per-step fail-soft try/except, same log messages, same metric step names fed to
``step_timer``.
