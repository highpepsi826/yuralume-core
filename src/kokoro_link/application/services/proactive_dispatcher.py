"""Proactive messaging dispatcher.

Coordinates a single evaluation pass for one character:

1. Short-circuit if the character opted out.
2. Collect cheap signals (idle time, sent-today count, last attempt
   time, current activity) and ask the gate.
3. Find an eligible binding (``accepts_proactive``). Without one there
   is nowhere to push, so we log and return.
4. Hand a ``ProactiveContext`` to the decider (LLM or stub). If it
   says no, log and return.
5. Run whatever tools the decision asked for, then put the composed text
   past the outbound honesty gate (HV2). A message that claims a
   completed external action the tools did not perform is withheld —
   see :meth:`ProactiveDispatcher._resolve_outbound_honesty` for why
   this surface needs the gate more than the promise loop does.
6. Append the generated message to the binding's conversation as an
   ``assistant`` turn and push to the platform. Failures are logged
   as ``ERRORED`` attempts so the operator can see them in the UI.

Every exit path writes a ``ProactiveAttempt`` — operators need the log
to debug "why didn't the character message me?" or "why did it again".

        Two exits, mirroring the promise loop's, because the honest way out
        of each is different:

        **Zero tool calls.** Nothing ran, so any claim of a completed
        external action is unsupported — and the judge's whole job is to
        tell that apart from a promise about later, an action inside the
        fiction, and the player's own material read back. One corrected
        re-decide follows, and it may legitimately come back either as an
        honest message *or* as the tool call it should have asked for the
        first time; both are the gate working.

        **Tools ran.** No re-decide, deliberately. The decider composes its
        message in the same JSON that orders the tool, so it has never seen
        a tool result and a second pass would be writing just as blind as
        the first — while being free to order a *second* render. Until
        ``ProactiveContext`` can carry ``tool_results``, the honest move is
        to spend nothing more and send nothing. A tick costs one tick.

        Never raises. A gate that can throw would turn a model hiccup into
        an ``ERRORED`` attempt, which is strictly worse than the
        dishonesty it exists to stop.

        nothing between ``Message.created_at`` and the decider prompt.
        If the summary ever misdates an event again, the raw tail sits

        The tail rides the existing ``recent_dialogue_summary`` field

        Returns the summary **and** the player's last line with its own
        ``created_at`` (G2-3): the quality gate's time anchor wants the

        the messages — which is also the only place that holds the

    """The 時間座標 block for one push: now, plus what it is answering.

    Proactive is the surface where a stale concern is most likely to
    surface as a fresh one — nobody wrote to the character, so the draft
    is built entirely out of material that already happened. The player's
    last turn is the anchor that matters (the 2026-08-27 incident was a
    「要回家了」 from sixteen hours earlier answered as if it were
    minutes), and the character's own last push is second: re-asking the
    same question a few hours apart is the same defect seen from the
    other side.

    Two *different* facts about the player, deliberately kept apart:

    * **說話** — ``last_player_message`` with ``last_player_at``, both read
      off the same ``Message`` by the dialogue load this tick already did
      (G2-3). This is the material a stale push is built out of, so it is
      the anchor the ``temporal_inconsistency`` rubric actually reads:
      「我要回家了」 sixteen hours ago is a concern that expired with the
      gap, 「下週要搬家」 is one that did not, and no timestamp alone
      separates them. The quote renders **only** with its own instant;
      dating it from anything else is the defect this parameter pair
      replaced (see ``_RecentDialogue``).
    * **互動** — ``idle_minutes``, i.e. ``last_active_at``. In cloud mode
      分歧劇場／起幕／融合故事 advance it without a ``USER`` message, so it
      answers "is the player around", never "when did they last speak".
      Kept because it is the only reading available at all when no
      summariser is wired (self-host, where the two coincide anyway), and
      labelled for what it is so the judge cannot read it as speech.

    ``idle_minutes is None`` means the pair never interacted; the block
    then simply omits that anchor, and the rubric pins the axis false on a
    block holding nothing but 現在 — the correct failure mode.

    ``generate_image`` call hard-failed and, under background policy, was
    withheld. The gate was systematically deleting exactly the messages it
    was least entitled to.

    Every call is rendered, not just the visual ones: the dispatcher cannot
    ask a ``ToolCall`` what it renders (the capability lives on the tool, not
    the call), and guessing from the name is the inference the tool contract
    explicitly forbids. Showing a labelled ``web_search query: …`` line costs
    the judge one line it can identify and dismiss; hiding a real image
    prompt behind a wrong guess costs the player the message.

    One line per argument rather than one per call, following the feed's
    ``"image_prompt: …"`` idiom: the rubric also has to be able to see a
    prompt that is malformed, and a JSON blob squashed onto a single line
