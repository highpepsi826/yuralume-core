"""Proactive messaging dispatcher.

Coordinates a single evaluation pass for one character:

1. Short-circuit if the character opted out.
2. Collect cheap signals (idle time, sent-today count, last attempt
   time, current activity) and ask the gate.
3. Find an eligible binding (``accepts_proactive``). Without one there
   is nowhere to push, so we log and return.
4. Hand a ``ProactiveContext`` to the decider (LLM or stub). If it
   says no, log and return.
5. Append the generated message to the binding's conversation as an
   ``assistant`` turn and push to the platform. Failures are logged
   as ``ERRORED`` attempts so the operator can see them in the UI.

Every exit path writes a ``ProactiveAttempt`` — operators need the log
to debug "why didn't the character message me?" or "why did it again".

    no content without the player, so the autonomous scan walks past it

    might reach out about.

    Why "due" (``scheduled_date <= today``) rather than the forward feed
    the arc block already carries: ``forward_beats`` is anchored at
    ``>= today`` and therefore *drops* a beat the day after it comes due
    — precisely when it has been waiting longest and an invitation
    matters most. The due window mirrors ``StoryArcService.
    _due_pending_beats`` so "waiting" means the same thing here as it
    does to the code that plays beats.

    ``BEAT_PENDING`` only, again matching the play-eligibility filter:
    ``active`` would mean the scene is already running, and inviting
    someone into a scene they are mid-way through is not an invitation.
