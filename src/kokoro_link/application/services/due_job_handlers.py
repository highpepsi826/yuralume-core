"""Per-kind handler dispatch + self-chain advance (HOSTED_CORE_SCALING §4.2 / §3.3).

Binds a claimed per-kind job to (a) the matching :class:`CharacterTickExecutor` step
and (b) the self-continuing chain: after the step runs, compute the next occurrence and
enqueue it, so the coordinator never has to re-enqueue this chain.

Two invariants carried straight from Phase 3 (§3.3, red line):

* **Handler pre-flight guard** — every kind re-validates the character *after* claim:
  existence, ``frozen`` / ``subscription_locked``, the subscription access guard and
  (NF4) dormancy. A stopped character runs no step AND enqueues no next job — the
  chain stops, and the reconciler reseeds it after a thaw / a foreground interaction.
  This is the shared cheap DB-only recheck that the Phase 3 spec put at the top of
  every tick; dormancy belongs in it for the same reason freeze does — the job was
  scheduled under the old answer, and the step is where the money is spent.
* **No provider filtering re-applied** — the B1 knob multiplier was already spent
  scaling the chain cadence at due time (§4.3.1); the handler does not re-filter, only
  the underlying services' own cooldown / cap gates decide whether visible work happens.

The handler owns *only* the character-scoped kinds; ``social_tick`` /
``character_tick`` / ``character_warmup`` stay on the existing executors (redrive
compatibility — § red line).
