"""Routing-level reasoning override — shared parse/serialise rules.

LLM routing preference entries (global ``feature_models[feature_key]``,
``feature_model_groups[group_key]``, the ``active_model`` fallback and
the ``nsfw_mode_target``) may carry an optional ``reasoning`` object
next to ``provider_id`` / ``model_id``::

    {
      "provider_id": "openai",
      "model_id": "gpt-5.2",
      "reasoning": {"reasoning_effort": "high"}
    }

When present, :class:`PreferenceBackedActiveLLMProvider` binds the
whole reasoning trio onto the resolved adapter for that call path,
replacing the provider connection's own reasoning defaults. Absent =
inherit the connection settings (pre-existing behaviour). An entry may
carry ONLY ``reasoning`` (no provider/model pin) — the model keeps
inheriting from the next layer up while the reasoning posture applies.

The raw shape is read in three places — the resolver (per call), the
startup :class:`ModelPreferenceValidator` (repair must not drop it) and
the system preference routes (API round-trip) — so the parse rules live
here once.
