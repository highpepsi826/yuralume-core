"""Hosted Official LINE Channel proactive delivery adapter (LH4, §8.3 / §4.4).

The Hosted counterpart of :class:`LocalMessagingProactiveDeliveryAdapter`.
Behind the same :class:`ExternalProactiveDeliveryPort`, it carries the character's
immutable proactive envelope to the Cloud Channel Hub instead of a self-host
messaging binding. Core still decides *what* to say; the Channel decides *whether
this channel can send it now*.

Two responsibilities beyond the raw HTTP client:

* **Eligibility caching (§4.4 / D2)** — the non-authoritative cost preflight is
  cached in-process with a short TTL (eligible 60s, negative 30s) so a per-tick
  preflight does not hammer the channel. A transient channel failure answers
  "not eligible" with the negative (short) TTL — acceptance revalidates anyway.
* **Attachment mapping (LH2 convention)** — proactive attachments are Core-owned
  URL-based :class:`OutboundAttachment`; the wire contract wants opaque
  ``AttachmentRef`` (``object_ref`` / ``media_type`` / ``size_bytes`` /
  ``sha256``). Each URL is reversed to its object key and ``stat``-ed; an
  attachment whose URL does not resolve to a known object is dropped with a
  warning (proactive attachments are Core-generated, so this is defensive).

Transport → ledger lifecycle (via :class:`HostedChannelProactiveClient`):

* accepted (``2xx``) → :class:`DeliveryAcceptance` ``ACCEPTED`` (settle: accepted).
* ``404`` no endpoint / ``409`` conflict → ``TERMINAL`` (settle: terminal).
* ``429`` / ``5xx`` / network → the transient error propagates, so the caller
  leaves the pre-send ledger row ``pending`` and re-sends the same event later.
