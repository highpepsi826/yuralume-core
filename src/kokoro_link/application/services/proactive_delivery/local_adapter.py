"""Self-host proactive delivery adapter (LH4, §8.3).

Wraps the existing self-host messaging path — the ``account`` / ``binding``
repositories and the per-platform channel adapters — behind
:class:`~kokoro_link.contracts.external_proactive.ExternalProactiveDeliveryPort`.
Behaviour is byte-identical to the dispatcher's former ``_deliver``: resolve the
eligible binding, self-heal / create its ``source=<platform>`` conversation,
append the assistant turn, and hand the segmented outbound to the platform
adapter. This is the default (and, for this batch, only) adapter the
composition root wires; the Hosted Channel adapter slots in behind the same port
in a later batch.
