"""Phase B — character replies to user comments on LumeGram posts.

Driven by ``ProactiveScheduler._tick_all`` (one ``tick(character)``
call per scheduler pass), mirroring ``FeedComposerService`` so the
fail-soft contract stays uniform: an LLM hiccup, a slow repo, or a
character who shouldn't reply right now must all degrade to "do
nothing this tick" without disturbing the rest of the scheduler loop.

## Why scheduler tick, not inline

Memorialised in ``project_feed_phase_b.md`` — the user (2026-04-30)
explicitly chose tick-driven over inline. The IG metaphor has the
character "online sometimes": a reply may land minutes or hours after
the comment, conditioned on whether the character is currently free.
Inline replies break that illusion and also burn LLM calls on every
keystroke-batch the user types.

## Algorithm (per character per tick)

1. Cheap gate — ``feed_daily_limit > 0`` flips the whole feature off.
2. Walk the recent posts (cap 20) once. For each post:

   * sort comments chronologically;
   * the watermark is the latest character-authored comment's
     ``created_at`` on that post (or epoch);
   * user comments after the watermark form the "unanswered batch".

3. Aggregate two cross-post metrics in the same pass:

   * the **latest** character-comment timestamp across all scanned
     posts → drives the global reply cooldown;
   * the count of character comments **today** (character-local
     date) → drives the daily reply cap.

4. Pick the post whose unanswered batch's *oldest* user comment is
   the earliest — FIFO fairness, the user's first unanswered
   complaint shouldn't get leapfrogged.
5. Reject the candidate if:

   * the batch's oldest comment is younger than ``min_wait`` (gives
     the user time to finish typing follow-ups before the character
     chimes in — IG-realistic);
   * the batch's newest comment is older than ``max_age`` (the
     conversation has cooled — replying now feels weird);
   * cooldown / daily cap not satisfied;
   * the character's *current* schedule activity is high-busy (we
     skip; next tick re-evaluates).

6. Compose via :class:`FeedCommentReplyComposerPort`. Empty body =>
   skip (do not advance any watermark; next tick retries).
7. Persist via :class:`FeedCommentService.add` with
   ``author_id=character.id`` so the same row layout that holds user
   comments now hosts character replies (no schema change).
8. Memorialise: write one episodic memory linking the user's batch
   to the character's reply so future chats can reference both
   sides naturally.
