"""角色資料邊界的**重置引擎**（CD3, ROADMAP #35）.

``reset_character_data`` used to carry its own private
``flag -> repository`` if/elif ladder inside ``character_service.py`` —
four blocks that were really one fact (which table each flag clears)
written out four times. That fact now lives in exactly one place, CD0's
``consumer_policies.RESET_FLAG_EFFECTS``:

* **which tables a flag touches** — resolved through
  :func:`~kokoro_link.application.dto.character_backup.consumer_policies.reset_effects_for_flag`,
* **which table's row count is reported** — resolved through
  :func:`~kokoro_link.application.dto.character_backup.consumer_policies.reset_primary_table_for_flag`,
* **how to execute it** — here (the port + the in-memory fallback) plus
  the SA adapter (:mod:`kokoro_link.infrastructure.persistence.sa_character_reset_eraser`).

This module holds no table list of its own. A flag's reach changing in
``consumer_policies.py`` changes what both erasers do without either one
being edited.

**Semantics carried over unchanged from pre-CD3** (CD0 already verified
and pinned these; this ticket does not revisit them):

* Each flag reports the row count of its *primary* table only —
  ``conversations=True`` reports the ``conversations`` table's count,
  not the ``messages`` / ``turn_journals`` / ``pending_follow_ups`` /
  ``story_scene_sessions`` rows the same reset also deletes through the
  conversation parent chain, nor the ``channel_bindings`` row whose
  pointer it nulls.
* ``PURGE_VIA_PARENT`` and ``CLEAR_REFERENCE`` tables are **not
  reported**, but they are still **acted on**: the SQL eraser emits an
  explicit ``DELETE`` / ``UPDATE … SET NULL`` for every such effect. The
  FK's ``ON DELETE`` verb is the schema layer *agreeing* with the policy
  — it is what makes the derived statement the correct one (it supplies
  the parent chain the statement filters through), never the mechanism
  the reset leans on. Self-host SQLite runs without
  ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`` (``persistence/engine.py`` never sets it),
  so an eraser that relied on the cascade would delete **nothing** at
  all there. See
  :attr:`~kokoro_link.application.dto.character_backup.consumer_policies.ResetPolicy.PURGE_VIA_PARENT`
  and :mod:`kokoro_link.infrastructure.persistence.sa_character_reset_eraser`.
* The character row itself is never touched by reset; only
  ``delete_character`` removes it.

    """Erasure through the repository ports — the DB-less container mode.

    ``repositories`` maps each flag to the one repository whose
    ``delete_for_character`` already implements that flag's primary-table
    purge. How far past that primary table a given repository reaches is
    its own business — this class only calls the one method every
    character-scoped repository exposes, and never assumes a database
    cascade cleans up behind it. **This mode is therefore narrower than
    the RESET policy's declared boundary**: the ``PURGE_VIA_PARENT`` /
    ``CLEAR_REFERENCE`` effects that :class:`SACharacterResetEraser`
    states explicitly have no repository to state them here. Acceptable
    for the same reason as
    :class:`~kokoro_link.application.services.character_data_erasure.RepositoryCharacterDatabaseEraser`:
    this is the DB-less development / test fallback, and the boundary is
    pinned against the SA path every real deployment runs.

    A flag with no repository wired reports zero rather than raising,
    matching pre-CD3 behaviour where an unwired repository silently left
    that flag's count at zero.

    ``secondary`` is for the tables a flag purges that are **not** reached
    through the primary repository and **not** reached by a parent
    cascade either — a table with its own ``character_id`` column and its
    own repository. ``dialogue_checkpoints`` is the one such table today:
    the RESET policy names it under ``CONVERSATIONS`` explicitly because
    nothing else would reach it, and a mode that skipped it would leave
    the accumulated summary pointing at deleted messages, which the
    prompt would then keep quoting back at a player who just cleared
    their history. Their row counts are deliberately not reported — the
    count is the *primary* table's, unchanged since pre-CD3.

    Pre-CD3, ``reset_character_data`` called one repository per flag, so

    silent no-op reporting zero. The SQL reset eraser has no such
    coupling — it derives its tables from the registry and would happily
    hard-delete ``operator_profile_fields`` on a deployment where the
    persona feature does not exist, which is a behaviour change CD3 is
    not allowed to make.

    So availability is re-attached here, in front of *both* persistence
    modes, rather than inside either one: the SQL eraser stays a pure
    registry derivation, and the two container modes answer identically.
