"""Inbound messaging dispatcher.

Inbound flow (platform-agnostic once the adapter has normalised payload):

1. Debounce by ``platform_message_id`` — webhook retries don't double-fire.
   Two layers: the process-local ``InboundDebouncer`` as a cheap front gate,
   then the durable ``InboundReceiptPort`` claim so a retry the load balancer
   lands on a *different* api replica can't re-run the whole turn
2. Load the ``MessagingAccount`` referenced by ``message.account_id``;
   drop silently if gone / disabled
3. Apply the account's ``allowed_sender_refs`` allowlist — anything
   outside gets dropped so stray DMs can't pollute the character's
   memory. Empty allowlist means accept everyone (convenient during
   first-bind; operators should lock it down after).
4. Find (or lazily create) the ``ChannelBinding`` for this (account,
   chat_ref). First contact from a chat spawns a fresh ``Conversation``
   tagged with the account's platform as ``source``; the id is written
   back so the same chat keeps the same thread.
5. Run ``ChatService.send_message`` — exactly the same pipeline the
   web UI uses, so character state / memory / goals / schedule stay
   coherent across every surface.
6. Hand the reply to the platform's adapter, passing the account's
   credentials per-call.

No platform-specific logic lives here — adapters handle that upstream
(webhook parsing) and downstream (REST calls to the platform).

**Conversation-busy rollback.** Step 5 runs under the per-conversation turn
lease, which rejects a delivery that overlaps a sibling turn. That rejection
happens before anything is written, so it must not consume the delivery: after
a bounded retry the dispatcher gives back *both* dedup stamps (durable receipt
and in-process debounce) and re-raises, leaving the transport free to
re-deliver. Every other failure keeps the historical semantics — swallowed,
stamps retained — because a turn that crashed mid-flight may already have
appended the user message and charged for it.

**Drain rollback (GD1-A).** A replica told to drain refuses new turns on the
first line of ``ChatService._begin_turn``, which puts a drained delivery in
exactly the conversation-busy shape: the claim was taken in step 1, nothing was
written, and the refusal is about *this replica*, not about the message. So it
is handed back the same way. Letting the generic ``except`` below swallow it
would be the worst possible outcome — the receipt stays stamped, the webhook
answers 200, the platform never retries, and the player's message is gone for
good with no error anywhere.
