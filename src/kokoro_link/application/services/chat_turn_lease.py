"""Per-conversation mutual exclusion for one player chat turn.

The chat hot path (``POST /chat/messages`` and ``/chat/messages/stream`` →
``ChatService``) historically had **no** per-conversation mutex at all. Two
turns that overlap on the same conversation do not lose data — the SA
repository's CAS append and the ``save()`` stale-version merge preserve both
tails — but they still produce three user-visible defects:

1. the earlier turn's messages can be reflowed *after* the later turn's, so the
   transcript reads out of order;
2. each turn's prompt was assembled before the other's rows existed, so the
   character answers the same moment twice, as if it had forgotten;
3. every post-turn side effect (memory extraction, state suggestion, schedule /
   arc adjustment, goal review) runs twice for one exchange.

A process-local ``asyncio.Lock`` cannot fix this under the hosted 2×api
round-robin topology, so the guard is a *lease*: the same TTL + fencing-epoch
contract the background coordinator, Creator Studio and the encounter pair
already use (``background_runtime_leases`` under postgres, an in-process
implementation for self-host). The self-host process therefore gets real
in-process exclusion from the same code path — the single-process deployment
had the identical bug and is fixed by the same mechanism.

Two deliberate differences from :class:`StudioExecutionLease`'s own usage:

* **owner id is per TURN, not per process.** The studio lease's process-wide
  ``owner_id`` exists so recovery can hand a target to the runner it spawns; a
  same-process re-acquire renews the same epoch and therefore *succeeds*. That
  is exactly the wrong answer here — two turns inside one api replica must
  exclude each other — so every turn mints its own owner and a sibling turn
  sees a live lease held by a different owner.
* **no waiting.** ``acquire`` either wins immediately or raises
  :class:`ConversationBusyError`; the route maps that to ``409``. Queuing a
  second turn behind a multi-minute streamed reply would just convert a visible
  conflict into an invisible timeout.

A turn is *not* required to finish inside this window — the session heartbeat
renews every ``ttl/3`` (60s), and a streamed turn with a tool cycle can run for
minutes. The TTL only bounds how long a **crashed** replica keeps a
conversation locked, so it is sized against two facts rather than against turn
duration:

* it must comfortably exceed any plausible event-loop stall between heartbeats
  (a sync embedder batch, a greenlet DB round-trip) — 60s of slack over the
  heartbeat interval is generous;
* it must stay *below* the 300s upstream LLM read timeout
  (``infrastructure/llm/*._REQUEST_TIMEOUT``), so a conversation stranded by a
  hard kill is reclaimable before the player's own in-flight request gives up —
  their natural retry then succeeds instead of hitting a stale 409.

The streaming turn's lease is handed from ``send_message_stream`` to the

If that owner is ever dropped without either (a response object that is
constructed but never iterated, say), an unbounded heartbeat would pin the
conversation for the life of the process — strictly worse than the TTL it was
meant to bound. After this many seconds the heartbeat stops and the lease ages
out normally. No real turn comes close: the upstream read timeout is 300s and a
tool cycle with a retry still lands far under 15 minutes.
