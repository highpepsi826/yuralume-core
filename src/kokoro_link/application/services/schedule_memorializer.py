"""Turn completed schedule activities into episodic memories.

Once an activity's ``end_at`` is in the past, we write a one-line
episodic memory so the character can later recall what they did —
"我今天下午在咖啡店寫了劇本大綱" — instead of only knowing their
current schedule block.

Design:

- Idempotent via the ``memorialized`` flag on ``ScheduleActivity``.
  Every run only processes activities that haven't been memorialized
  yet, so calling this after every turn is cheap.
- Yesterday's schedule is scanned too, to cover the case where the
  user didn't chat after an activity completed (e.g. overnight gap).
- Memories pass through the existing ``deduplicate`` filter before
  being persisted, preventing near-duplicates when the user edits a
  schedule and re-runs.
- Salience is derived from ``busy_score`` with a small floor so even
  very idle blocks ("睡覺") are still remembered — they carry
  relational value even if they're not exciting.
- An activity carrying an operator commitment is *not* a record of a
  shared experience (CF4). The planner writes it as a plan ("與木木一起
  前往先前約定的刨冰店"), and turning that plan into a memory verbatim is
  how the system came to "remember" an outing the user never agreed to
  and never attended. Such activities are memorialised only through the
  aftermath model's own account of what happened, written under the
  structured evidence in
  :mod:`kokoro_link.domain.services.shared_activity_evidence`; with no
  such account, nothing is written.
- **Single writer for story beats (KB2 red line).** A block carrying
  ``ScheduleActivity.source_beat_id`` is the slot the schedule planner
  reserved for the day's arc beat — a plan for a scene, not an hour the
  character lived. It is latched and never memorialised, unconditionally
  and without consulting the beat's status: the beat's record is written
  by the realize path
  (:mod:`kokoro_link.application.services.story_event_service`, OP2-E)
  and nowhere else. A pending beat has nothing to remember yet, and a
  realized one has already been remembered there; either way a memory
  written from here would be a second writer for the same event. This is
  the fix for the incident where a beat the player was central to got
  staged as a solo day and became a memory of something the player never
  took part in. Preparation *for* a beat carries no lineage and is
  memorialised normally — the character really did spend that hour
  getting ready.
- Because of that, ``memorialized`` means only "this run considered the
  block" — the idempotency latch. Whether a memory actually exists is
  ``has_memory``, and CF3's expiry sweep
  (:func:`kokoro_link.domain.entities.schedule.expire_operator_commitment`)
  reads that flag, not the latch: a shared plan latched with no memory is
  still an appointment that has to lapse.
