"""Candidate collection for the feed composer.

Each tick the composer asks ``FeedCandidateCollector.collect(character)``
for a tuple of candidates — small immutable structs describing
*why* a post might fire (what just happened in the world / the chat /
the character). The composer then dedupes, scores, and (for the
top-1 winner) materialises a post.

Sources are deliberately read-only here: the collector touches repos
to build candidates but never writes — all persistence is the
composer's job. Each collector method is fail-soft so one slow / down
adapter doesn't take the whole tick down with it.

Sources covered (Phase 1):

- **schedule_just_finished**: a ScheduleActivity that ended within the
  past N minutes. Hook for "剛下班，超累" style posts.
- **today_beat_realized**: a story-arc beat that materialised earlier
  today. Hook for "今天做了……感覺很……" reflective posts.
- **fresh_high_salience_memory**: a recently-extracted memory with
  salience above a threshold. Hook for relationship reflection.
- **silence_since_last_user**: derived signal — user hasn't sent a
  message in N hours. Hook for the canonical "為什麼還沒回？" mood
  post.
- **state_shift**: a meaningful state delta since the last post (mood
  flip, energy crash). Hook for organic state-driven posts.
