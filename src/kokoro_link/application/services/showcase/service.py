"""The showcase pipeline's application service.

Core's half of the public wall: it reads the character's own data, runs
the two LLM steps (advisory pre-review, translation) and renders the
snapshot document. It stores **nothing** — the owner's decisions, the
translation cache and the published document all live in the Cloud
control plane, which is the only place a human ever approves anything.

That split is deliberate. Approval is an operations decision about a
public marketing surface; the posts, the schedule and the character card
are Core's data. Copying the posts out to decide about them would create
a second, drifting copy of private content in a service that has no
business holding it.

Every entry point is tenant-scoped. A character id alone is not
authority: pointing this at the wrong character would publish a paying
player's private feed on the front page, so the tenant that owns the
character is checked on every call and a mismatch is indistinguishable
from "not found".
