"""Preference-backed ``ActiveLLMProviderPort`` implementation.

Three layers of preference drive resolution, highest priority first:

- Per-character ``character.feature_models[key]`` — only consulted
  when the caller passes a ``character`` to the resolver. Lets
  operators pin one character to a different LLM than the rest of
  the app (e.g. character A on Anthropic Sonnet while the global
  picker stays on LM Studio).

- Global ``feature_models`` — per-feature overrides written by the
  advanced per-feature picker. Shape::

      {
        "post_turn": {"provider_id": "anthropic", "model_id": "..."},
        "goal_review": {"provider_id": "lmstudio", "model_id": "..."},
        ...
      }

- Global ``active_model`` — provider/model pick written by the
  frontend's primary model picker. Shape::

      {"provider_id": "anthropic", "model_id": "claude-sonnet-4-5"}

Final fallback is the container's default provider id. Unknown
``feature_key`` or malformed entries degrade silently to the next
level — auxiliary services are non-critical path, they should not
crash the turn.

        the MODEL, so a lower layer's flag is eligible only when no

          pins a provider/model ALL lower-layer flags are suppressed —
          they describe different models. A character entry pinning
          nothing does not block (kept symmetric with the metadata-only
          exemption below).
        * feature entry flag — eligible when the character layer did
          not pin.
        * group entry flag — eligible only when the feature entry also
          does not pin a provider/model. Even when the feature pins only
          model_id (provider falls through), the capability-determining
          model came from the feature layer, so the group's flag —
          written for the group's own pick — must not ride onto it.
        * active_model flag — eligible only when no layer above pinned
          a provider/model. Otherwise an active_model
          ``supports_vision: true`` (set for e.g. an OpenAI pick) would
          bleed onto a group-pinned text-only aggregator model and
          re-attach images to it.

        pin) does NOT block lower layers — the model came from the next
