"""Row/media landing pipeline of a ``.lumebackup`` restore (CB3).

The data-moving half of the import, split from
:mod:`character_backup_import_service` (which keeps job lifecycle,
staging, preview, gates, recovery and cleanup):

- **scan pass** — one streaming read of every CARRY table builds D4's
  single id map (each carried row gets its fresh uuid up front, so
  forward references such as ``story_arc_beats.realized_event_id``
  rewrite correctly regardless of landing order), the set of source
  operator ids, and the media worklist *after* NSFW folding — a
  hosted-dropped message's attachment never even uploads;
- **landing pass** — rows land in registry CARRY order through the
  restore writer with the full rewrite rule set: FK-introspected columns
  strictly (missing target → NULL when nullable, row-skip otherwise,
  with the two shared-pool targets — global story seeds and pack arc
  series — resolved by batched existence checks), ``character_id`` /
  ``operator_id`` by name (several CARRY tables are deliberately
  FK-less), loose provenance refs through the id map, URLs through the
  media plan, and a uuid-token rewrite over every remaining string
  column (opaque JSON payloads included);
- **media transfer** — referenced originals re-``put`` under the new
  character's *real* prefixes so ``VariantAwareObjectStorage``
  regenerates the WebP renditions on its own (plan §3.2 零額外工作).
