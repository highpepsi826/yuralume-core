"""Post-turn auto-trigger for memory decay + consolidation.

Sits between ``ChatService`` and ``MemoryConsolidationService``. After a
turn writes new memories the trigger decides whether now is a good time
to run the expensive pipeline:

- **Threshold gate**: only fire when the character already owns enough
  memories that a merge pass is worth it. Running on small pools just
  burns LLM credits.
- **Cooldown + single-flight claim**: one atomic
  ``claim_consolidation_slot`` on the character repository. It stamps
  ``last_consolidated_at`` only when the previous stamp is older than the
  cooldown, so the same statement answers both "has the cooldown elapsed?"
  and "is anyone else already running?" — across processes.

Why the claim is not in-process state: ``maybe_trigger`` is fired
fire-and-forget from the chat turn, and the hosted topology serves chat from
several api replicas. The previous ``_last_run_at`` dict / ``_running`` set /
``asyncio.Lock`` trio was per-process, so two replicas could run
``consolidate()`` — an LLM-heavy pass that rewrites memory rows — for the same
character at the same time and overwrite each other, while the effective
cooldown shrank by a factor of the replica count. The lock and the ``_running``
set survive as a *cheap local gate* that spares the DB a round-trip for the
same-process overlap; correctness now rests entirely on the claim.

The caller fires ``maybe_trigger`` fire-and-forget; this class never
raises into the chat path.
