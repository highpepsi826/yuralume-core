"""Layer 3 of the 起幕 waterfall — the ad-hoc side story (SC1-B).

The bottom of the §3.1 waterfall, reached when there is no beat to play
and no season to open: a concluded series, a planner that failed, a fresh
arc that came back empty. It exists so that pressing 起幕 practically
always raises a curtain — "劇情不卡住" is the feature's whole promise, and
a button that answers "沒有素材" is the failure it was built to remove.

What makes it different from the two layers above it:

* **It builds no arc and claims no beat.** ``arc_id`` and ``beat_id`` stay
  ``None``, which is what tells the service not to record a play attempt
  and (SC1-D) tells the close path to land the scene as an ordinary
  episodic memory instead of realizing a beat. An impromptu scene is
  canon — it happened, the character remembers it — but it is not a
  chapter of a planned season.
* **Its material is assembled, not planned.** Relationship footing, the
  memories with the most pull on the character right now, what the two of
  them were last talking about, and — when the pool has any — a couple of
  ``dramatic`` story seeds as raw subject matter. No LLM call of its own:
  the single opener call is where the semantics happen, and adding a
  second model round trip to the bottom of a fallback chain would put a
  new failure mode underneath the one that is already failing.
* **Every source is optional.** Nothing here is a precondition. A brand
  new character with no memories, no seeds, an unreachable summarizer and
  no relationship seed still gets a scene, because the character sheet the
  opener already holds is enough to act from. That is what "fail-soft"
  has to mean for the layer whose job is to catch everything.

The ``dramatic`` seed pool being empty (SE3
not yet imported on a given deployment) is therefore *normal operation*,
not a degraded mode — the material simply narrows to relationship plus
memory, exactly as the plan's residual note anticipates.
