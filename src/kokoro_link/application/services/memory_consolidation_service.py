"""Orchestrates memory decay + LLM consolidation.

Two-stage pipeline:

1. **Decay**: drop memories that match the heuristic decay rule (low
   salience + old + never accessed). Pure bookkeeping, no LLM.
2. **Consolidation**: cluster surviving memories by embedding
   similarity, ask the LLM consolidator to merge each cluster into one
   higher-quality memory, swap the originals out.

Both stages support ``dry_run=True`` — nothing is mutated, the report
still describes what would have happened. Useful from the CLI to
preview before pulling the trigger on a large character pool.

Consolidated memories inherit:

- ``content`` / ``salience`` / ``tags``: from the LLM proposal
- ``kind``: same as the cluster (clustering never crosses kinds)
- ``character_id`` / ``conversation_id``: from the cluster's first item
- ``created_at``: the **oldest** original — preserves the temporal
  anchor so recency scoring still places the merged memory where the
  original knowledge began
- ``access_count``: sum of the originals (preserves "this was useful")
- ``embedding``: re-computed via the injected embedder at persist time
  so the merged vector actually represents the merged text
