"""Per-replica drain switch for rolling deployments (GD1-A).

The graceful-deploy work measured what a hosted
``--force-recreate`` costs today: the in-flight turn dies at the SIGKILL that
follows the grace period, its conversation lease stays held until the 180s TTL
lapses, and the action charge it reserved sits on the player's wallet until the
stale-reservation sweeper finds it. Crash-safety already guarantees none of that
*corrupts* anything — GD's job is to stop the deploy path from relying on it.

The mechanism is deliberately one boolean and one counter:

* ``draining`` — flipped once, never back. A replica that has been told to drain
  is on its way out of the process table; "un-drain" would only exist to paper
  over an aborted deploy, and a replica that flip-flopped would be a replica
  whose observed ``active_turns`` could not be trusted. Restart is the reset.
* ``active_turns`` — how many player turns are mid-flight *right now*. This is
  the number ``deploy.sh`` polls to zero (§7.3 GD1 step 3) before it recreates
  the container, so it must count exactly the work that a SIGKILL would destroy.

**Off by default, and off is the historical behaviour verbatim.** Self-host
never posts to the drain endpoint, so ``draining`` stays ``False`` for the life
of every self-host process and every path below reduces to an integer increment.

Why the state is an object on the container rather than a module global: a
module global would be shared by the several containers a test session builds in
one interpreter, so one test's drain would leak into the next. One instance per
container is one instance per process in production, which is the scope that
actually matters — a drain request addresses *this replica*.
