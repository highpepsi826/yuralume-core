"""Schedule application service.

Lazily generates a character's ``DailySchedule`` on first use per civil
date. Used by ``ChatService`` to enrich prompts with what the character
is currently doing and what's up next.

Design choices:

- Resolves the character owner's fixed user timezone for civil dates and
  local activity times. The constructor ``local_tz`` is only a legacy
  fallback for tests or unwired services.
- ``ensure_schedule`` is idempotent: once a schedule for a date exists,
  it is returned as-is. Force refresh goes through ``regenerate``.
- The planner produces the schedule; the service only wires it to the
  repository. That keeps the LLM/Stub switch isolated.

        routes pass it so the same-day weather refresh can never rebuild
        an edited day and resurrect a deleted activity. LLM post-turn
        callers keep the default ``False`` so the refresh still works for
        days only the model has touched.

        Adjustments are bucketed by their effective date (
        ``target_date_iso`` when set, otherwise ``date_`` arg, otherwise
        today). The "today" bucket — if any — drives the return value
        for backward compatibility; future-date buckets are processed
        as a side effect and surfaced through ``ensure_schedule`` later.

        For future dates the behaviour is **lazy-create + seed**: if no
        schedule row exists yet for that date, one is created with
        ``is_planned=False`` containing only the chat-extracted
        commitments. The next ``ensure_schedule`` pass (background tick
        or on-demand) reads those seeds and asks the LLM planner to
        weave a full day around them. ``remove`` / ``modify`` against
        a non-existent future row are dropped silently — there's
        nothing to remove or modify yet.

        Rules:

        - ``add`` requires start/end/description/category — creates a
          new ``ScheduleActivity`` in the character's local timezone.
        - ``remove`` drops the matching activity.
        - ``modify`` replaces fields that are non-``None``; fields left
          as ``None`` stay as-is. Already-memorialised activities are
          **not** modified — we preserve the recorded history.
        - New / modified blocks that overlap existing ones trim the
          latter's start forward so ``activity_at`` stays unambiguous.
