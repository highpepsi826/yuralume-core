"""Story arc orchestration.

Wraps the ``StoryArcRepositoryPort`` + ``StoryArcPlannerPort`` and
exposes the operations the chat / REST / post-turn pipelines need:

- ``ensure_active_arc`` — lazy: if the character has no active arc,
  plan one. Called by ``StoryEventService.ensure_today`` so the very
  first turn with a brand-new character kicks off narrative continuity
  without the operator having to click anything.
- ``start_new_arc`` — explicit creation (UI button / post-turn), takes
  optional ``hint`` text the operator provides.
- ``force_open_season`` — ``ensure_active_arc`` minus the season
  decider's timing judgement, for the 起幕 button (material layer 2).
  Series-aware, unlike ``start_new_arc``.
- ``abandon_arc`` — mark an arc abandoned + mark all its pending beats
  skipped. Idempotent.
- ``realize_beat`` — called after a beat is performed and becomes a
  ``StoryEvent`` to record the event id + flip beat status to realized.
- ``next_beat_due`` — which beat (if any) should be surfaced today?
  Used by ``StoryEventService.ensure_today`` and ``BeatDueChecker`` as
  the arc-driven override for random gacha / proactive prompting.
- ``forward_beats`` — feed prompt builder with "this and next up"
  context so the model can anticipate ("再 3 天試鏡").
- ``apply_adjustments`` — post-turn LLM signals: advance_beat,
  delay_beat, modify_beat, insert_beat, mark_realized. Each operation
  is narrow so the LLM can be nudged toward specific actions instead
  of free-form rewrites.

        A beat that failed ``max_attempts`` times used to sit ``pending``
        forever: invisible to the autonomous scanner, still first in line
        for the chat path, and recorded nowhere as dead. It is flipped to
        ``skipped`` with ``retry_exhausted`` as its play result so the arc
        moves on — "劇情不卡住" is the point —
        and a warning carries the ids, Core having no alert service.

        Deliberately *not* folded into ``next_beat_due``: that is a read
        path shared with chat, and a permanent status flip must only
        happen where the caller already owns write side effects. Returns
        the updated arc, or ``None`` when there was nothing to retire —
        which makes repeat calls no-ops rather than repeat writes.

        The write is beat-level and conditional, never ``save``. This runs
        on the background scanner while chat and the scene service are
        writing to the same arc, and ``save`` rebuilds every beat row from
        the snapshot loaded above: a scene that finished (and was charged)
        between the load and the write would be reverted to ``pending``,
        losing the canon and leaving the beat playable — and payable —
        again. ``skip_beats_if_pending`` lets the DB decide which rows may
        still move, so a beat someone else realized is simply not ours to
        retire.
