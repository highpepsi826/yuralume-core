"""Proactive scheduler — tick loop + event queue.

A single asyncio task drives two input sources:

* **Tick**: every ``tick_seconds`` it sweeps every proactive-enabled
  character and fires a ``ProactiveTrigger.TICK`` evaluation.
* **Events**: explicit integrations may call :meth:`notify_event` to
  enqueue an evaluation without waiting for the next tick.

The scheduler coordinates time/cost gates and pushes semantic evaluations
to the ``ProactiveDispatcher``. The dispatcher gate and decider still decide
whether any proactive message actually happens.

Started from the FastAPI lifespan so it stops cleanly on shutdown.
