"""起幕 — the player pulls the next piece of story instead of waiting.

SC1-A implements the first layer of the §3.1 waterfall end to end: the
active arc's next pending beat becomes an opening (narration + the
character's first line + a visible scene frame), the opening lands in the
character's ordinary web thread, and a ``story_scene_sessions`` row marks
the character as being inside a scene until SC1-D/E close it.

Four behaviours are worth reading the code for, because they are choices
rather than mechanics:

* **The waterfall is a list, not a chain of ifs.** ``material_providers``
  is walked in order and the first answer wins, so SC1-B's forced-season
  and side-story layers are two appended objects, not an edit here.
* **Failure writes nothing, and (hosted) charges nothing.** The opening is
  generated *before* any row is created, and the session row is deleted
  again if the messages cannot be appended. A player who was charged for
  an opening that never happened is the hosted red line (§3.4 #2), and a
  half-open scene would lock them out of the button until the timeout
  closer ran. The one price is therefore raised as late as it can be —
  after every refusal this service can answer on its own — and released
  by the same exception that fails the action (SC3-C).
* **A player pull is not a retry.** Staging attempts are recorded with a
  non-failure result, so pressing 起幕 never spends the autonomous scene
  writer's retry budget for that beat (SC0 / §10 #3).
* **The scene is claimed in the database.** "One live scene per
  character" is a partial unique index, not a read-then-write here; two
  taps landing on two replicas is a race the schema settles.

SC1-D added the other end. Three routes can wrap a scene up — the verdict
after an in-scene turn (:meth:`close_if_resolved`), the player's
「結束場景」 button (:meth:`end_scene`), and SC1-E's idle sweep — and all
three funnel into :meth:`close_scene`, whose steps live in
``story_scene_closing``. One implementation on purpose: the red line that
a wrap-up must never invent player actions is only as strong as its
weakest path, and the timeout path is the one nobody is watching.
