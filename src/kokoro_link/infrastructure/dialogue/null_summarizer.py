"""Null dialogue summarizer.

Returns empty string unconditionally — used by the fake provider / tests
where we don't want to spend an LLM call on conversation compression.
Downstream planners treat empty as "no dialogue context" and skip the
relevant prompt section, so the system keeps working end-to-end.
