"""LLM writer for the wrap-up of a player-pulled story scene (SC1-D).

One prompt serves all three ways a scene can end, because they differ
only in framing and in who decides:

* ``resolved`` — asked after an in-scene turn: *is this scene finished?*
  Almost every call answers "no" and stops there, which is why the
  unfinished verdict is deliberately the cheapest possible reply.
* ``manual`` — the player pressed 「結束場景」. Already decided; write it.
* ``timeout`` — the player left and never came back (SC1-E). Also already
  decided, and framed from 「你離開之後，她自己…」 rather than from a
  scene the two of them ended together.

**The red line lives here, not only in the prompt.** The model is told never to describe a player action the
transcript does not show — and it is also required to *cite* the
transcript line behind any player action it does describe. This module
checks those citations against the lines the player really produced and
throws the whole draft away when one of them is invented. It is not a
content filter and does not read the prose for banned phrases (that
would be the keyword special-casing the LLM-first rule bans); it is a
provenance check, the same shape as every other "quote your source"
seam in this codebase.

The check has one absolute case and one partial one. Absolute: a scene
where the player never spoke has no player actions at all, so *any*
citation is a fabrication and the draft is refused outright. Partial: a
model that simply reports no citations is trusted, because there is
nothing left to verify against. That asymmetry is honest about what a
provenance check can and cannot do, and it is why the prompt carries the
same rule in words.

Failure is degradation, not an exception, and the direction depends on
who asked. Refer to :class:`StorySceneCloserPort` for why ``None`` means
"the scene continues" on the verdict path and "close it anyway, without
prose" on the two forced paths.
