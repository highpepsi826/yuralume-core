"""HTTP client for the Hosted Official LINE Channel Hub delivery API (LH4).

Core owns *whether* a character has a semantically-worthwhile proactive message
and *what* it says; this client only carries the immutable envelope to the
Channel Hub, which owns *whether this channel can send it now* (active endpoint,
opt-in, quiet hours, quota — plan §4.4). Two internal endpoints are reached, both
behind the structured service credential (``caller=core``, ``audience=
yuralume-channel``):

* ``GET  /internal/v1/delivery-eligibility/{tenant}/{account}/{character}``
  (scope ``delivery:eligibility-read``) — non-authoritative cost preflight. The
  verdict lives in the response BODY (``eligible``), not the status code: the
  channel answers ``200`` for "no, this character is not opted in" too.
* ``POST /internal/v1/deliveries`` (scope ``delivery:create``) — durable accept
  of an :class:`ExternalDeliveryEnvelope`; ``202`` (or an idempotent replay of
  the same ``event_id``) means transport-accepted.

Transport-classification contract (mapped to ledger lifecycle by the adapter):

* ``2xx`` accept → :class:`ChannelAcceptResult` ``ACCEPTED`` with the channel's
  ``delivery_id``.
* ``404`` → ``NO_ENDPOINT`` (terminal — nowhere to deliver).
* ``409`` → ``CONFLICT`` (terminal — same ``event_id`` reused with a different
  payload hash).
* ``429`` / ``5xx`` / network / timeout → :class:`ChannelDeliveryTransientError`
  (retryable — the caller leaves the ledger row ``pending`` and re-sends the
  same event later).

Timeouts are bounded (eligibility 5s, delivery 10s) and message content is never
logged — only the ``event_id`` and transport status reach the log.
