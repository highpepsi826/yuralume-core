"""Cheap heuristic proactive gate.

Signals (all short-circuit, in order):

1. Character state has ``last_active_at`` — user must have been idle
   for at least ``_MIN_IDLE_MINUTES`` so we don't interrupt an ongoing
   conversation.
2. Per-day rate limit (``character.proactive_daily_limit``) respected.
3. Per-attempt cooldown (``character.proactive_cooldown_minutes``)
   since the last logged attempt of any outcome — keeps the dispatcher
   from burning tokens evaluating every tick. This is the only signal
   ``cooldown_exempt`` can waive (a deferred motive's ``revisit_at``
   alarm coming due).
4. **Night-hours floor** — regardless of schedule, don't fire between
   ``_QUIET_HOUR_START`` and ``_QUIET_HOUR_END`` in the character's
   local time. This is a hard safety net so a server restart at 00:53
   can't send a "早安" message in the middle of the night. It's a
   belt-and-braces defence — the schedule-aware check below also
   catches this when a daily schedule has been generated, but that
   requires ``schedule_resolver`` wiring which the proactive path
   historically skipped.
5. Schedule-aware quiet period: if the character's current activity
   category reads like sleep / rest (or energy is very low), skip.

All of this is pure Python and returns in microseconds, so it's safe
to run on every tick.
