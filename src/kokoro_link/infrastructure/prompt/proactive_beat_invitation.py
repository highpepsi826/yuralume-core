"""Shared prompt fragments: the scene that is waiting for the player.

Both proactive surfaces — the intention judge ("is there a real reason to
spend a slot?") and the decider ("write the message") — need to see the
same two facts about *the one beat that is waiting*: where the player
stands in that scene (``operator_position``) and what their part is
(``operator_note``). The phrasing lives here so the two paths cannot
drift into telling the character opposite things about the same beat —
the same reason ``proactive_streak`` exists.

OP3. A beat marked ``central`` is a
scene *about* the player that cannot be played without them, so the
autonomous scan walks past it (OP2-B) and it simply waits. Waiting is
exactly the situation where a real person would reach out — "there's
something I want to go through with you" — so the fact is surfaced to
both proactive surfaces as one more candidate motive.

**Scope discipline**: these renderers are for the *due and pending*
beat only. Player position deliberately does not reach the decider's
forward-feed listing of upcoming beats: a central beat scheduled for
next week would otherwise announce "she cannot go on without you" days
before anything is owed, manufacturing invitation pressure that the
waiting-beat selection upstream explicitly refused to create. OP3's
acceptance criterion — no due central beat ⇒ behaviour identical to
before — has to hold for judged arcs, not merely for legacy ones whose
fields happen to read back empty.

LLM-first stance: everything here is a **fact layer plus an
open door**. Nothing decides that a waiting beat *must* produce a push:
the judge still weighs it against timing and quota, the decider still
defaults to silence, and the invitation wording is the character's own —
there is no template sentence, no "有一段劇情在等你" system notice, and
no keyword branching anywhere in the pipeline.
