"""Deferred proactive intent — short-lived "motive half-life" record.

When the proactive ``intention_judge`` blocks a tick despite the cheap
gate passing, the inner motive the judge identified does not simply
vanish. We persist it as a ``DeferredIntent`` with a TTL (default 24h)
and re-surface it as a fact-layer block in subsequent intention judge
calls. The next pass can then re-evaluate "is the timing right *now*?"
in light of all currently-active deferred motives, rather than the
character forgetting an authentic urge the moment one bad moment passes.

Design notes (HUMANIZATION_ROADMAP §3.4):

- **LLM-first 紅線**: this entity stores *facts* the judge produced
  (motive / purpose / risk / best-timing text). The decision whether to
  act on a re-surfaced motive belongs to the LLM, never to an if-else
  branch. We do **not** add a "score" or "priority" the dispatcher
  reads programmatically.
- **TTL is hard**: expiry is a property of the row, not a heuristic.
  Past ``expires_at`` the entity is filtered out before prompt
  injection regardless of status. Background GC then marks them.
- **Per-(character, operator)**: same isolation rule as
  ``OperatorPersona`` / ``EmotionEvent`` — a motive learned for one
  pair never bleeds into another.
