"""Multi-week story arc domain entities.

Sits between ``CharacterGoal`` (user-typed todos, open-ended) and
``StoryEvent`` (atomic, one-day narrative) as the **narrative spine**
driving a character's world for weeks at a time. A ``StoryArc`` has:

- A ``title`` / ``premise`` / ``theme`` describing the overall plot
- A series of ordered ``StoryArcBeat``s scheduled on specific dates
- Beats progress through tension levels (setup → rising → climax →
  falling → resolution) so the prompt builder can forward-feed
  anticipation ("再 3 天她就要上台了")

**Why a separate entity from StoryEvent**: events are the performed
materialization; arcs are the plan. A beat, when its scheduled date
arrives, is surfaced as a scene directive. It becomes a ``StoryEvent``
only after a chat/proactive turn actually plays the beat and the
post-turn processor marks it realized. Beats not yet due stay pending
and can be moved / rewritten by either the operator (via UI) or the
chat (via ``arc_adjustments`` in the post-turn processor).

**Immutability**: both entities are frozen dataclasses — mutation
goes through ``with_*`` helpers that return new instances, matching
the rest of the codebase.
