"""Character feed post entity (動態牆).

A ``FeedPost`` is an Instagram-style entry the character autonomously
publishes during a ProactiveScheduler tick. It pairs a short narrative
text with an optional image and a provenance pointer back to whatever
domain object inspired it (a schedule activity, a story beat, a memory,
a world event, or a derived signal like "user has been silent").

**Design choices**

- Frozen dataclass + ``with_*`` mutators: matches the rest of the
  domain layer; easy to test and reason about.
- ``image_url`` is optional because image generation can fail
  (ComfyUI unreachable, timeout); the post still ships text-only
  rather than the whole tick failing.
- ``source`` is a ``FeedSource`` value object — the (kind, ref_id)
  tuple drives composer-time dedup so the same beat doesn't spawn
  two posts on a single day even if the tick fires twice.
- ``reactions_seen_at`` records the moment the character last "read"
  user reactions; Phase 2 will use it to build a delta of unseen
  likes/comments to feed into prompts. Phase 1 leaves it ``None``.
- ``reaction_summary`` is a denormalised snapshot of reaction counts
  so the API can render cards without touching the reactions table.
  Phase 1 keeps it at zero; Phase 2 updates it when reactions land.
- ``viewed_at`` records the moment the *player* actually saw this post
  (KB11 of ``PLAYER_KNOWLEDGE_BOUNDARY_PLAN``) — distinct from
  ``reactions_seen_at``, which is the character reading reactions. A
  single-user world has exactly one reader, so one nullable timestamp
  is enough; no per-viewer table. This is the read-side foundation KB8
  will later use to flip a post's source ``private`` memory to
  ``disclosed`` — this entity only records the fact, it does not
  translate it into any memory-visibility decision.
