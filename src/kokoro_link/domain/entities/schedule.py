"""Daily schedule domain entities.

A ``DailySchedule`` is a character's planned activities for one real-world
date in the character owner's fixed user timezone. It consists of a tuple
of ``ScheduleActivity`` blocks that describe what the character is doing
during a given time range.

Design notes:
- ``category`` is an open-ended free-form string so characters can express
  unique, creative activities ("觀星" / "寫歌詞" / "和貓發呆"). A VO was
  considered but rejected — open strings align with ``MemoryKind`` style
  and give the LLM room to be imaginative.
- Activities are **non-overlapping**: the builder trims overlaps before
  persistence, so ``activity_at`` is unambiguous.
- A gap between activities is simply "idle time" — not every minute of
  the day needs to be filled.
- ``date`` is the civil date in the character's timezone (server TZ for
  Phase 1). ``start_at`` / ``end_at`` remain absolute UTC datetimes so
  boundary comparisons are DST-safe.

    plan the user never agreed to, and the three renderers each grew their
    own copy of the day list, so one shared function is what keeps them from
    drifting apart again (plan §2 P1c).

    check only (:func:`has_expired_operator_commitment`) — the activity's own
