# An active story-arc beat just realized on its scheduled date via the

# beat as a stronger signal than "5 minutes passed".
ProactiveTrigger.ARC_BEAT = ProactiveTrigger("arc_beat")
# Releasing a queued ``PendingFollowUp``: the user previously sent a
# message during a high-busy_score window, got a brief in-character ack,
# and is now owed the actual reply. Distinct from TICK so the gate /
# dispatcher can bypass quiet-hours, daily-limit, and cooldown — this is
# a promise being fulfilled, not an unprompted push.
ProactiveTrigger.PENDING_FOLLOW_UP = ProactiveTrigger("pending_follow_up")
# Releasing a scheduled message promise: the user previously asked the
# character to message them at a specific future time (例:「明天 10 點叫我
# 起床」「中午記得提醒我吃飯」) and the post-turn extractor lodged a
# ``PendingFollowUp`` row with ``kind="scheduled_promise"``. Bypasses
# quiet_hours / daily_limit / cooldown / proactive_enabled gates — it's
# a promise being fulfilled, the user explicitly asked for this push.
ProactiveTrigger.SCHEDULED_PROMISE = ProactiveTrigger("scheduled_promise")
# An operator picked this character out of the dormant-reactivation
# console and pressed send (LR series, plan D3). Distinct from TICK
# because the rhythm throttles below the gate — min-idle, daily limit,
# cooldown, low energy, quiet activity — all exist to keep the *scheduler*
# from pinging someone unprompted, and a human deliberately choosing this
# character is the opposite situation. Deliberately **not** grouped with
# the promise-fulfilment triggers: those bypass quiet hours too, and
# nobody asked for this one, so 03:00 is still 03:00. The four semantic
# gates (intention judge / decider / quality / honesty) also stay on — a
# recall message that reads badly is a second injury, not a save.
