"""Collapse cross-channel mirror copies of the same delivered message.

A character is one person on every channel, so LLM context is built from
``ConversationRepositoryPort.recent_messages_for_character`` — the
**merged** timeline across web / telegram / line / …. That merge is
correct for inbound turns (each user message exists once, on the channel
it arrived through) but wrong for **outbound fan-out**: a proactive push
is delivered to the web conversation *and* to the bound messaging
conversation, so the same sentence is persisted as two rows under two
conversations, seconds apart.

Observed damage (2026-07-29 dump, P7a): one proactive line appeared four
times inside a single chat prompt — twice in the 「近期對話」 transcript
and twice again in the 「你本對話最近自己說過的話」 anti-repetition rail —
and the diversity statistics measured a 1.000 self-similarity because the
embedding of a line was compared against the embedding of its own mirror
copy. That false signal then drives the anti-repetition machinery to
"correct" a repetition that never happened.

**The rule here is structural, never semantic.** Two entries collapse
only when they are byte-identical after whitespace normalisation, carry
the same role / kind / attachments, and land within a short window of
each other. No fuzzy similarity, no keyword matching — this is a
schema-level operation on duplicated rows, which the project's LLM-first
directive explicitly permits (unlike rewriting user-visible prose).

Nothing is deleted: both rows stay in the database, on their own
conversations, exactly as delivered. Only the *prompt material* is
collapsed.

    checkpoint identifies its coverage boundary by exactly that
    timestamp plus a fingerprint of the surviving row — so the prompt
    (which named a preferred conversation) and the background checkpoint
    updater (which has none) picked different survivors and then
    disagreed about whether the boundary message was covered. A rule
