"""Execution seam for driving one external-chat turn through :class:`ChatService`.

DR-LH0-004 makes a hosted external-chat turn a *recoverable state machine*, not a
single row written after the fact. :class:`ChatService.send_message` owns the
prompt / memory / tool pipeline and the one LLM call; it must NOT own the durable
turn spine (claim / lease / CAS append / snapshot / post-turn intent). This port
is the thin seam the turn service injects so ChatService can hand every
*conversation write* and every *stable identity / anchor* decision to the durable
layer — while the LLM pipeline itself is untouched.

Design contract ("Seam 介面"):

* ``external_turn=None`` → ChatService is bit-identical to the pre-LH2 web path.
  Every hook below fires only inside ``if external_turn is not None:``.
* The port NEVER holds a DB transaction across the LLM call, and the external
  conversation write never goes through the whole-conversation ``save()`` replace
  (that lost-update path must not become an external concurrency primitive).
* Every method is idempotent under recovery: a re-driven turn that already
  persisted its user / assistant row returns the existing ref and does NOT
  rewrite it.

This is a **pure abstraction** — it does not import the receipt repository. The
turn service (Core-C2) wires a concrete adapter that fences every write on
``owner_id`` + ``lease_version`` and CAS-appends via
``ConversationRepositoryPort.append_messages``.
