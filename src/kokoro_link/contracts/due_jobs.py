"""Phase 5 per-kind due-time job registry (HOSTED_CORE_SCALING §4.2 / §4.3 / §5).

Phase 3 packaged all per-character background work into a single ``character_tick``
job the coordinator enqueued for *every* active character *every* bucket (a full
table scan). Phase 5 replaces that with **per-kind self-continuing due jobs**: each
class of activity carries its own ``due_at`` cadence, and each job — on completion —
computes its own next due time and enqueues the next occurrence (a self-chain). The
coordinator no longer scans; it only runs a low-frequency *reconcile* that reseeds a
chain when one is missing (new character, thaw, or a broken chain).

This module is the **registry** only: it declares each character-scoped kind with

* its **priority** (§5: pending follow-up=1〔next 段〕, beat / schedule repair=2,
  proactive=3, feed=4, upkeep / maintenance=5),
* its **capability** (``llm`` / ``image`` / ``none``) so the next 段 can apply
  capability-specific concurrency caps (§5) without re-deriving it,
* its **base cadence** (seconds) — the interval the self-chain advances by before the
  B1 knob multiplier is applied (:mod:`due_job_scheduler`),
* which **knob multiplier** gate scales that cadence (``proactive`` /
  ``background`` / ``none`` — §4.3), and the optional
  :class:`BackgroundActivityClass` a handler re-checks at apply time,
* whether it is **event-driven** (``feed_comment_reply`` prefers a high-priority job
  enqueued at the player-comment write point; the chain is only a fallback recheck).

Nothing here runs providers or mutates state — it is a pure, importable declaration
consumed by the calculator, the reconciler and the handler dispatcher. It is
**distributed-only** by construction: the embedded (self-host) scheduler never reads
this registry (§ red line — embedded behaviour is byte-identical).

#: the composer's own semantic decision, taken on the first compose pass. So the
#: release does not *predict* it — it **discovers** it and hands the GPU half over
#: to this kind, which is the one the §5 ``image`` ceiling counts.
#:
#: Why a second kind rather than declaring the release itself ``image``: the claim
#: filter is per-kind, evaluated before the job runs, and the overwhelming majority
#: of fulfilments are text. Putting them all under a 1-wide ceiling would park a
#: player's owed message behind somebody else's picture. Splitting after pass 1

#: extraction is offloaded to a worker instead of running inside the API request.
