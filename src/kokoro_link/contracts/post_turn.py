    carried by the same three fields (the semantic difference lives in
    ``intent``, not in the schema):

    - **errand** — the user asked to be texted/woken/reminded at a moment
      (例: "明天 10 點叫我起床" / "中午記得提醒我吃飯").
    - **rendezvous** — both sides agreed to *do something together* at a
      concrete time (例: "19:30 一起上線核對任務"). The character has to
      show up and open the conversation, otherwise the user waits alone;
      recording this only as a :class:`ScheduleAdjustment` leaves the
      appointment silent.
    - **completion** — the user asked the character to come back after
      finishing something ("查完資料再找我") with *no* agreed time. The
      extractor estimates a natural completion moment for
      ``scheduled_for_iso`` so the promise still enters the mechanism
      instead of drifting forever.

    Routes through :class:`PendingFollowUp` (``kind=scheduled_promise``)
    so the proactive dispatcher actually sends the message — bypassing
    quiet_hours / daily_limit / cooldown gates because this is a
    promise fulfilment, not unsolicited push.

    Distinct from :class:`ScheduleAdjustment(action="add")` even though
    the same chat turn often generates both: the schedule-adjustment is
    "the character's day now contains a 10am wake-up activity", while
    the message-promise is "the character will actually send an
    outbound at 10am". Without the promise the schedule activity sits
