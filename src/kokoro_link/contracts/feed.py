"""Ports for the character feed-wall layer (動態牆).

Two ports keep concerns separated:

- ``FeedPostRepositoryPort`` — CRUD + queries needed by the API and
  the composer (dedup, today's count). In-memory + SA implementations.
- ``FeedComposerPort`` — the LLM-backed adapter that turns a candidate
  signal into post text. The application service composes candidates
  and calls this port; a ``NullFeedComposer`` no-ops so feature flags
  (no LLM available) cleanly suppress the whole pipeline without the
  caller having to special-case the absence.
