"""Port for character-authored replies to user comments on feed posts.

Phase B of LumeGram. Where ``FeedComposerPort`` produces an
autobiographical post + image prompt, this port produces a single
short comment that the character writes back at the user — closer in
shape to a chat reply than to a post body. Kept as its own port so
the prompt template, output schema, and adapter cost can evolve
independently from the post composer (different feature key for LLM
routing, different output JSON, no image generation).

Adapters must be fail-soft: any error returns an empty body. The
service treats an empty body as "skip this round" — no exception
escapes into the proactive scheduler tick.
