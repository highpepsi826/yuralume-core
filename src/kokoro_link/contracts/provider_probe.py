"""Shared shapes for adapter-owned live-probe hooks.

The provider-settings live probe (admin "Test" button) is an
orchestrator: it builds the real runtime adapter from the draft
config/secret and asks the adapter to run its own cheap self-test.
Adapters that support this expose an optional async hook — feature
-detected via ``getattr``, mirroring the ``validate_reasoning_effort``
precedent — that owns the request shape end-to-end:

* chat models      → ``probe_chat()``
* embedders        → ``probe_embedding()``
* TTS adapters     → ``probe_tts()``
* image providers  → ``probe_image_generation()``

Because the hook reuses the adapter's own payload builders and
signal-driven retry/memo machinery, a quirk fixed in the adapter is
automatically exercised (and surfaced) by the probe — request shapes
are owned in exactly one place.

Contract:

* A hook returns ``list[ProbeCheck]``; ``action`` must be one of the
  shared probe action enum values (``listed_models`` /
  ``chat_completion`` / ``embedded`` / ``listed_voices`` /
  ``synthesized_speech`` / ``generated_image`` …) so the engine can map
  checks 1:1 onto its pinned ``ProbeReport`` API contract.
* Hooks accept an optional ``transport`` (httpx test/probe seam) and a
  ``timeout_seconds`` budget; both are threaded by the probe engine.
* Hooks should not raise for expected failures — use
  :func:`run_probe_check`, which maps network errors to the same
  wording the engine historically produced. The engine still fail-softs
  anything that escapes.
* Details need not be pre-sanitized: the engine passes every detail
  through its secret scrubbing choke point.
