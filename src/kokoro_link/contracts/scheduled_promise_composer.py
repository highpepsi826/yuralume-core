"""Scheduled-promise composer port.

Sibling of :class:`PendingFollowUpComposerPort` but for the
``scheduled_promise`` variant of :class:`PendingFollowUp`: the user
explicitly asked the character to message them at a specific future
time ("明天 10 點叫我起床" / "中午記得提醒我吃飯") and the post-turn
extractor lodged a queued row. At the promised time the dispatcher
calls this composer to write the actual outbound message.

Unlike the busy-defer composer, there's no inline brief_reply to honour
and no queued user-messages backlog to wrap up — the message is
generated fresh from persona + promise_intent + current schedule
context. Output is a single string; empty = retry next tick.

**Two-pass tool use (PF1).** A promise is often a promise to *do*
something ("晚點回家幫你查", "等等傳照片給你"), so the composer may
answer a compose call with ``tool_calls`` instead of prose. The
application layer — never the adapter — executes those calls through
``ToolOrchestrator`` and composes a second time with ``tool_results``
filled in; see
:mod:`kokoro_link.application.services.composer_tool_loop`. Both extra
fields default to empty, so a composer that ignores them (or a
deployment with no tool registry) behaves exactly as it did before.
