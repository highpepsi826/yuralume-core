"""Ports for the player-pulled story scene (「起幕」, SC1).

Five seams live here:

* :class:`StorySceneSessionRepositoryPort` — the DB-backed scene state.
* :class:`StorySceneMaterialProviderPort` — one layer of the §3.1
  waterfall. SC1-A ships only the first (pending arc beat); SC1-B adds
  the forced-new-season and ad-hoc-side-story layers by appending
  providers to the service's ordered list, with no edit to the opening
  path itself.
* :class:`StorySceneOpenerPort` — the single LLM call that turns the
  chosen material into narration + the character's first spoken line +
  the visible scene frame.
* :class:`StorySceneChipsWriterPort` — the suggested in-scene actions
  offered after the opening and after every in-scene turn.
* :class:`StorySceneCloserPort` — the wrap-up (SC1-D): the verdict on
  whether the scene is finished, the closing narration, and the summary
  of what was actually performed that lands as canon.

Kept out of ``contracts/story_arc.py`` on purpose: two of the three
waterfall layers do not involve an arc at all, so the scene runtime must
not be typed as an arc feature.
