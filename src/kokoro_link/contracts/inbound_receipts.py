"""Port for the durable inbound-delivery receipt ledger.

``InboundDebouncer`` remembers the last ``platform_message_id`` per
``(platform, chat_ref)`` in a **process-local** dict. The Telegram / LINE
webhook routes run the entire chat turn inside the request handler, so a slow
LLM turn makes the platform time out and re-deliver; under a multi-replica
hosted topology (or any multi-process self-host) the load balancer can land
that retry on a *different* instance whose dict is cold. The turn then runs
twice: two outbound replies to the user and two charges.

This ledger is the cross-instance half of the same guard: one row per
delivery, claimed by a DB unique index, so exactly one instance may proceed.
The in-memory debouncer stays in front of it as a cheap same-process gate.

Key composition — ``(platform, account_id, chat_ref, platform_message_id)``:

* ``platform_message_id`` alone is NOT globally unique. Telegram's parser
  mints ``"{chat_id}:{message_id}"`` (message_id restarts per chat) and
  WhatsApp's mints ``"{chat_ref}:{message_id}"``; only LINE and Discord ids
  are globally unique on their own.
* ``chat_ref`` alone does not disambiguate either. A Telegram private chat's
  ``chat.id`` **is the user's own id**, identical across every bot that user
  talks to, so two accounts bound to the same human mint colliding
  ``chat_ref:message_id`` pairs. ``account_id`` is therefore part of the key
  — without it the second bot's message would be silently eaten, which is a
  worse failure than the duplicate this ledger exists to prevent.
* ``account_id`` never varies across retries of one delivery: the webhook
  route resolves the account from the request path/credentials before
  building the ``InboundMessage``, so adding it cannot weaken the dedup.

The claim is consumed on *attempt*, not on success — same as the debouncer's
stamp-then-process order. A turn that crashes mid-flight is not retried by a
later re-delivery; that is the deliberate trade (a crashed turn already wrote
partial state, and re-running it would double-charge).

The one exception is a turn that never started: the per-conversation chat turn
lease rejects a delivery that overlaps a sibling turn (``ConversationBusyError``)
*before* anything is written, so the claim is handed back via
:meth:`InboundReceiptPort.release_claim` and the platform's re-delivery is
allowed through. Without that rollback a player who sends two messages quickly
loses the second one for the whole retention window — strictly worse than the
duplicate reply this ledger exists to prevent.
