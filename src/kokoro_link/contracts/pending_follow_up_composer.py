"""Deferred-reply composer port.

Runs at the proactive-scheduler tick when a queued ``PendingFollowUp``
row's release conditions are met: the character is no longer high-busy
and the scheduled time has arrived. The composer reads the queued user
messages + the brief in-character ack the user already saw + chat
context, and writes the actual full reply.

Output is a single string. The dispatcher fans it out through the same
web SSE + Telegram/LINE delivery path proactive messages use, and
writes a ``proactive_attempt`` row with ``trigger=PENDING_FOLLOW_UP``
for telemetry / cooldown tracking (the gate bypasses cooldown for this
trigger).

Per the project's top directive, the composer reads the persona + the
queued conversation and writes its own call — no templating, no
keyword catalogue. ``recent_dialogue_summary`` provides "what the
character has been talking about lately"; ``current_activity`` (after
the busy one ended) helps the model write a believable transition
("剛開完會") instead of an abrupt context-free continuation.
