"""Core-side view of hosted **action-level** credit charging (AP2).

Under ``billing_shape=token_floating`` every Gateway call reserves and settles
its own credits, so one chat turn produces as many ledger rows as it made HTTP
calls. Under ``billing_shape=action_fixed`` the *player action* is the billing
unit: Core charges the configured fixed price once at the action's entry
point, stamps every call the action makes with the resulting interaction scope
(see :mod:`kokoro_link.contracts.interaction_context`), and settles at the end
— one action, one ledger row, a price the player knew before pressing the
button.

Two failure policies, deliberately different:

* **Cloud unreachable / malformed answer** → :class:`ActionChargeUnavailable`.
  The billing service logs, counts, and lets the action run uncharged. Never
  blocking play on the wallet service is the same fail-open the User service
  applies to a missing price; a player mid-sentence must not be bricked by a
  billing outage.
* **Out of credits** → the upstream 402 becomes an
  :class:`~kokoro_link.infrastructure.llm.cloud_refusal.ExpectedCloudRefusal`
  with code ``insufficient_credits`` and travels the U4 structured-error path
  already wired through every foreground route.
* **The price moved** → the upstream 409 becomes :class:`ActionPriceChanged`.
  Every charge is bound to the price Core displayed (``expected_price_cr``), so
  a back-office edit mid-session refuses the charge instead of billing a number
  the player never agreed to.
