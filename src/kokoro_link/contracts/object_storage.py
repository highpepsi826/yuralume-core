#: Key prefixes whose objects are short-lived staging material, not durable
#: media. Three independent components have to agree on this set, which is why
#: it lives on the port rather than in any one of them:
#:
#: * the **writer** (``CharacterDraftService``) builds keys under it and deletes
#:   them as soon as the call that needed them is over;
#: * the **storage service** TTL-sweeps it as the backstop for whatever a crash
#:   or a failed delete left behind;
#: * the **variant decorator** skips its WebP fan-out for it — nothing under
#:   these prefixes is ever rendered by a UI, so the renditions would be dead
#:   weight paid for in the foreground latency of a charged action.
#:
#: A prefix restated in any of those three places instead of imported here is a
#: second definition that can drift: a writer whose keys nobody sweeps, or a
#: sweeper deleting a prefix nothing writes.
#:
#: ``character-backups/`` (CB2) holds encrypted ``.lumebackup`` export
#: artifacts awaiting download. Ephemeral on purpose (plan §8: 產物走
#: ephemeral TTL，不常駐佔 hosted 儲存), and the variant decorator skipping
#: it is load-bearing twice over: the artifact is not an image, and WebP
#: renditions of an encrypted blob would be pure dead weight. The storage
#: service sweeps it on a longer, download-window TTL than the draft
#: staging prefix — see ``storage_service.app.EPHEMERAL_PREFIX_TTL_OVERRIDES``.

class SupportsPrefixPurge(Protocol):

    Deliberately kept **out** of :class:`ObjectStoragePort`, for the same

    existed, test doubles, and any decorator that wraps a port without
    forwarding unknown attributes all remain valid ports. Callers detect
    this capability with ``getattr(port, "purge_prefix", None)`` +
    ``callable(...)`` before calling it — never with ``isinstance``.

    Why this needs its own primitive instead of enumerate-then-``delete``:
    content-addressed keys such as ``tts/{character_id}/{digest}.{ext}``
    (built once, in ``application/services/tts_service.py``) are never
    persisted to a DB row — the digest *is* the key, derived at read time
    from generation parameters, not looked up. There is therefore no set
    of keys any caller can enumerate to delete one at a time; the only way
    to reclaim them is to remove everything under the character-scoped
    prefix they all share.

    Fallback semantics for a caller that finds no such capability (CD2):
    skip the prefix cleanup and log it — never fail the surrounding
    operation. A character delete's DB-tracked object keys (avatar,
    gallery images, ...) are still removed individually through
    :meth:`ObjectStoragePort.delete` regardless; only the untracked,
    content-addressed remainder is left behind when this capability is
    absent, which is strictly the pre-CD1 behaviour, not a regression.

    Contrast with :meth:`ObjectStoragePort.delete` plus the variant
    decorator's per-key fan-out: deleting one key there means deriving
    each of its fixed variant suffixes and deleting those too, because a
    variant lives at ``{object_key}.{variant_name}.webp`` — a key the
    decorator must construct, not discover. A prefix purge needs no such
    derivation: that variant key already starts with ``object_key``, so
    it already starts with any prefix ``object_key`` starts with, and a
    purge removes it for free as part of the same subtree.
    """

    async def purge_prefix(self, *, prefix: str) -> int:
        """Delete every object whose key starts with ``prefix``.

        Returns the number of objects removed — one per distinct object
        *key* (a WebP variant such as ``{object_key}.{name}.webp`` is its
        own key under the same subtree, so it counts too), never inflated
        by adapter-internal bookkeeping: a backend that keeps a metadata
        sidecar per object (one JSON file alongside each blob) purges that
        sidecar as part of the same call but does not count it a second
        time. A ``prefix`` that matches nothing is not an error — it
        returns ``0``.

        Implementations validate ``prefix`` the same way
        :func:`~kokoro_link.infrastructure.storage.keys.validate_object_key`
        validates a full key, plus the additional shape constraints in
        :func:`~kokoro_link.infrastructure.storage.keys.validate_purge_prefix`
        (trailing ``/``, at least two segments): a bulk, irreversible
        delete must never be reachable with an empty or single-segment
        prefix, which would purge far more than one character's objects.
