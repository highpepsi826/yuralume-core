        """Build prompt context for model generation.

        ``stage_nudge`` (SN1) says the player pulled this turn instead of
        speaking: they asked the character to open, optionally after
        declaring something about the scene. The builder renders one extra
        conditional block; ``False`` (every other turn, every caller that
        knows nothing about the flag) leaves the prompt byte-identical.

        ``now`` is the wall clock at the moment this reply is being
        generated; the builder renders it as local time so the model
        can reason about "it's late", "just after lunch", etc.
        ``idle_minutes`` is the gap since the user last sent a message
        — lets the character acknowledge "good morning" / "been a
        while" naturally without the caller having to craft prose.
        Both default to ``None`` which the builder treats as "no such
        signal available" rather than fabricating zeros.

        ``calendar_context`` is the same pre-rendered natural-language
        block the schedule planner sees, describing today's real-world
        civil calendar (weekday, national holiday, 連假 position,
        nearby holidays, season). Empty string = no calendar provider
        wired; the builder renders nothing for the calendar section.

        ``weather_context`` is the same pre-rendered current-weather
        block used by schedule/proactive/feed.

        ``story_scene`` is the character's live 起幕 scene, when there is
        one. Present = this turn is being played *inside* a framed scene,
        so the builder renders the frame (title / place / mood / scene
        type / dramatic question) as a directive and suppresses the
        ordinary 「今日場景指引」 block — two directives about the same
        beat, one saying "let this scene happen naturally" and one saying
        "you are already in it", pull the model in opposite directions.
        ``None`` (every non-scene turn, every caller that never opened a
        scene) leaves the prompt byte-identical to before SC1-C.

        ``world_event_context`` is an optional read-only RSS fact block
        for chat. It may include source locale and operator location;
        the builder renders it as facts and the LLM decides relevance.
        Each event line carries the original link so the character can
        ``web_fetch`` it when the player asks for detail the clipped
        summary does not hold.

        ``world_event_recall`` is the same fact shape for events this
        character **already raised** with the player on another surface
        (a proactive DM today, other surfaces as they start recording
        mentions). It is a distinct block because the instruction is the
        opposite of the candidate one: candidates may be dropped,
        recalled events the character is expected to still know. A
        consumed event never appears in ``world_event_context`` again —
        its inbox row is claimed — so without this the character forgets
        material it brought up itself.

        ``image_recognition_context`` is the multimodal recognition
        summary for a text-only main model (empty when the model sees
        images natively or no images exist). The builder renders it in
        the prompt body next to the ``[圖 N]`` legend — callers must
        NOT append it after the assembled prompt, where it lands behind
        the instruction footer and reads as part of the user's message.

        ``upcoming_day_schedules`` is the next 1–2 already-planned days
        after today (rolling-window pre-plan). The builder renders them
        compactly (tomorrow more detailed than day-after) so the chat
        model can answer "明天有空嗎 / 後天要幹嘛" against the same
        schedule the planner will actually produce on those days,
        instead of fabricating commitments that won't match. Empty
        list (or omitted) = no pre-planned upcoming days yet; the
        builder appends a "remote future is vague" guard so the model
        admits it hasn't decided.

        ``player_persona_note`` is what the player *declared* about
        themselves for this relationship (identity / world premise), as
        opposed to ``operator_persona_lines`` which is what the character
        *inferred* from talking to them. The builder renders it as its own
        adjacent block with a performance-authorization rail; ``None`` or
        empty leaves the prompt byte-identical. Callers must apply the same
        gate they apply to the operator persona — a channel that may carry
        someone other than the account owner is not the owner's stage.
        """
