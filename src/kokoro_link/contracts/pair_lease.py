"""Pair-lease port for encounter-style background jobs (Phase 5 §6.1).

An *encounter* (and any future two-character background mutation) runs on a
PAIR of characters. The existing per-character single-flight guard protects
one character at a time; it cannot express "the same encounter must hold BOTH
characters, and neither character may be simultaneously claimed by a second,
different pair". This port is that guard.

Design invariants every adapter (in-memory + SQLAlchemy) MUST honour
identically so the parity tests hold:

* **Canonical pair** — ``acquire(char_a, char_b, ...)`` sorts the two ids to a
  canonical ``(low, high)`` order, so ``(A, B)`` and ``(B, A)`` address the
  same logical pair and the same two underlying per-character lease rows.

* **Atomic two-row acquire, all-or-nothing** — a pair lease is two
  per-character rows (``encounter:<char_id>``). ``acquire`` takes BOTH in one
  transaction, always in ascending row order, and is atomic: if EITHER row is
  already held by a live lease belonging to another holder, the whole acquire
  fails and leaves NO residual row behind (the transaction rolls back). It
  never returns a half-held pair.

* **Single character ⇒ single pair** — because the unit of leasing is the
  *character* row and every acquisition stamps a fresh unique ``token`` as the
  holder identity, a character already leased (by ANY pair, even one driven by
  the same worker) blocks a second acquire touching it while the lease is live.
  This is what forbids "one character in two concurrent encounters".

* **Deadlock-free** — every acquire locks its (up to two) rows in ascending
  ``encounter:<char_id>`` name order. With a single global lock order no
  wait-for cycle can form, so crossing pairs ``(A,B)`` and ``(B,C)`` cannot
  deadlock: whichever transaction takes the shared row ``encounter:B`` first
  wins it, the other blocks and then fails that row (B is held) — B is never
  claimed by both.

* **TTL + heartbeat, no long transaction** — the lease carries a TTL
  (``lease_until``); the holder renews it with ``heartbeat`` between LLM calls
  rather than holding a DB transaction open across a model round-trip. An
  expired lease is re-acquirable by any holder and can no longer be renewed by
  its former holder (tenure/fencing semantics identical to the background
  coordinator lease). ``heartbeat`` returns ``False`` the instant the lease was
  lost (expired, or the row taken over) — the caller's abort cue.

No epoch is exposed: the fencing identity is the opaque per-acquisition
``token``. Once another holder takes over a row (bumping its epoch under the
hood), the stale holder's ``token`` no longer matches and its ``heartbeat``
fails — the same abort signal the studio lease derives from an epoch mismatch.
