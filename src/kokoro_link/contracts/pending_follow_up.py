"""Pending-follow-up repository port.

Storage-agnostic CRUD for the deferred-reply queue. In-memory adapter is
used by unit tests; the SQLAlchemy adapter persists in the
``pending_follow_ups`` table.

Lookups the service / dispatcher need:

* ``find_open_for_conversation(...)`` — when a new user message lands,
  see if there's already an open row to merge into (the *merge-don't-
  cancel* policy).
* ``list_due(...)`` — the proactive-scheduler tick walks rows whose
  ``scheduled_for <= now`` and ``status == queued`` (or ``resolving``
  left dangling by an earlier crash), grouped by character so the
  dispatcher can apply per-character gating.

Cascade helpers mirror the journal / arc / schedule shape so character
deletion stays atomic.
