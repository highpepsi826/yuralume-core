"""Pending-follow-up repository port.

Storage-agnostic CRUD for the deferred-reply queue. In-memory adapter is
used by unit tests; the SQLAlchemy adapter persists in the
``pending_follow_ups`` table.

Lookups the service / dispatcher need:

* ``find_open_for_conversation(...)`` / ``list_open_for_conversation(...)``
  — the newest open row, or all of them. A conversation can hold several
  (one busy-defer plus any number of scheduled promises), so anything
  that must not miss one takes the list.
* ``list_due(...)`` — the proactive-scheduler tick walks rows whose
  ``scheduled_for <= now`` and ``status == queued`` (or ``resolving``
  left dangling by an earlier crash), grouped by character so the
  dispatcher can apply per-character gating.

Cascade helpers mirror the journal / arc / schedule shape so character
deletion stays atomic.

        The one write on this port that is **not** a whole-row upsert, and
        it exists because its caller cannot use one. The HV4 chat audit
        (F5) merges a newly-caught claim into a repair row it wrote
        minutes ago: read the intent, add a line, write it back — the
        read-modify-write shape that cost PF three rounds of repair. Two
        audits racing (one failing capability, a player asking twice)
        would both read the same intent and the later ``save`` would
        erase the earlier one's claim, which is precisely the lie-goes-
        unowned outcome the feature exists to prevent.

        So the update is conditional, and the condition is the field
        itself: ``expected_intent`` must still be what the caller read.
        Whoever writes second finds the predicate false, is told so, and
        opens its own row instead — occasionally two repair rows, never a
        dropped claim.

        Two further predicates come along because they are the same
        atomicity question asked about the row's *lifecycle*, and asking
        them in Python before this call would only re-open the window
        they close:

        * ``status`` must still be ``queued``. A row already ``resolving``
          is being composed right now, from a copy read before this merge;
          the dispatcher will write that copy back when it finishes.
        * ``scheduled_for`` must still be in the future. A row that is
          already due may have been handed to a release worker in this
          very tick, and that worker's blind row-level ``save`` would
          overwrite this merge with no way to notice.

        ``updated_at`` is advanced to ``now`` so the row's own staleness
        sweeps see the touch. Nothing else on the row is written.

        A conversation can hold more than one open row at a time, and the
        docstring that used to claim otherwise ("only one row per
        conversation may be open") was wrong: the merge policy collapses
        *busy-defer* rows into one, but ``_persist_message_promises``
        appends a ``SCHEDULED_PROMISE`` row per extracted promise without
        ever looking for an existing one. A conversation with an open
        busy-defer row and a newer promise row is ordinary.

        So this is a "give me one" convenience, not a census — and the
        one it gives is not necessarily the one any particular caller
        means. ``ChatService`` cancels the open **busy-defer** row via its
        own kind-filtered lookup, which is a different row from the one
        this returns. Anything that has to reason about *all* open rows —

        open *busy-defer* one — which ``find_open_for_conversation``
        silently loses the moment a newer scheduled-promise row exists,
