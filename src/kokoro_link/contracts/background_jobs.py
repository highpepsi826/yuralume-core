"""Ports and contracts for the durable background-job queue (P2-A).

This is the *foundation only*: the schema, value objects and ports that
the distributed Hosted topology (coordinator / worker) will consume in
P2-B. Nothing here is wired into any running process — it is entirely
additive and dormant.

Design invariants that every adapter (in-memory + SQLAlchemy) MUST honour
identically so the parity tests (§14) hold:

* **Idempotency** — at most one *active* (``queued``/``claimed``) row may
  exist per ``idempotency_key``. ``enqueue`` returns ``None`` (not an
  error) when an active row already exists; the same logical key may
  recur once the previous occurrence reached a terminal status.
* **Lease + fencing** — a claimed job carries a TTL lease
  (``lease_owner`` / ``lease_until``). A worker may only ``complete`` /
  ``fail`` / ``extend_lease`` a job whose lease it still holds *and whose
  lease has not expired* (``lease_until >= now``). An expired claimed job
  is re-claimable by any worker (attempt is charged again).
* **Coordinator epoch** — ``enqueue`` validates ``spec.fencing_epoch``
  against the current ``background-coordinator`` lease *in the same
  transaction, under a row lock* (``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE``): the lease
  must still be live (``lease_until >= now``) AND its epoch must equal
  ``spec.fencing_epoch``. A partitioned ex-coordinator carrying a stale
  epoch — or one whose own lease has expired — is silently rejected
  (``None`` + warning), never allowed to insert. The row lock is what
  makes this atomic against a concurrent takeover: the takeover and the
  fencing read serialise on the lease row, so no stale row can slip in
  after a takeover commits.
* **Retention (拍板 2026-07-20)** — ``done``/``failed``/``superseded``
  rows prune after 7 days; ``dead`` rows after 30 days, with NO
  auto-retry — admin manual ``redrive`` only.

Payload discipline (§3.1 / §11): ``payload`` carries IDs / dates / config
versions ONLY — never prompts, provider tokens or chat content;
``last_error`` carries an exception class + a sanitised summary — never a
secret.
