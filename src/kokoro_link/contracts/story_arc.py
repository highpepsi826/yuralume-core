        up whatever thread the conversation is already pulling on instead
        of starting cold. Empty string = no context available.

        ``today`` is the operator-local civil day the plan is being made
        on. It is usually equal to ``start_date`` but diverges on a
        mid-arc replan, where beats resume after the last realized one.
        Implementations use it to give the model absolute-date anchors so
        beat prose does not freeze relative time words ("明天") that go
        stale the moment the beat is read back a day later. Optional:
        implementations must degrade gracefully when it is ``None``.

        ``seed_candidates`` are ``dramatic``-tier story seeds offered as
        *subject-matter candidates* — raw material, never instructions.
        The planner is free to weave 0–2 of them into the arc, rewrite
        them beyond recognition, or ignore the lot; when it ignores them
        it still owes the arc an external event of its own. Empty tuple =
        no candidates available (empty pool, no gacha wired, or the roll
        failed), which must render exactly like the pre-seed prompt.

        ``arc_history`` is the anti-repetition input: pre-formatted
        one-line digests of this character's previous arcs, **oldest
        first**, already excluding whichever arc the call is about. The
        planner must keep the new arc's core conflict clearly distinct
        from every entry. Semantic judgement only — no keyword or
        similarity matching anywhere in this path.

        ``operator_relationship_lines`` are pre-rendered facts about the
        *player*: how the character addresses them, how they address the
        character, the relationship label and how close the two stand
        (OP1-A). Until this existed the planner knew the player only as
        a continuity constraint and could not even name them, which is
        why beats came back with the player structurally missing. Empty
        tuple = no relationship material recorded, and the prompt then
        omits the section entirely rather than rendering an empty
        heading — an unfilled slot is something a model will try to
        fill.

        The planner must always return a valid arc (at least one beat).
        On LLM failure, fall back to a sparse synthetic arc — the
        service layer treats a missing arc and an empty arc equally
