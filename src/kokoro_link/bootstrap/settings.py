Eight because that is the **pre-DH3 window**

allowed to widen what the prompt loads, never to narrow it below what
the path it replaces had. Below this floor nothing fails loudly, and
which way it fails silently depends on the number:

* at or under the raw tail (three messages), the middle band is empty
  on every turn — no checkpoint is ever written and the feature is
  inert while looking perfectly configured;
* just above it, the pressure backstop's margin (three more) is already
  spent, so a merge fires on essentially *every* turn: the per-turn LLM
  call DH3 exists to remove, reinstated;
* and at any value below the floor, the "no checkpoint yet" fallback
  slices the last eight messages off a list that now holds fewer, so
  the prompt runs on less history than it had before the flag was
  turned on.

    Traditional-Chinese chat — a message is typically 20-40 estimated

    reaches each message well before it scrolls out of the window.

    Setting it too high is no longer *silent*, whatever the number: the
    updater also merges when the middle band approaches what the window
    can hold, and logs that it had to. But the backstop exists to stop
    data loss, not to excuse a misconfigured trigger — a deployment
    where every merge is pressure-triggered is one where this number
