"""Liveness probe (HOSTED_CORE_SCALING §2.1 — role-aware health).

``GET /health`` is what the compose healthchecks and ``deploy.sh``'s
health-wait poll. A flat 200 is a lie for the ``background`` role: that
process serves no API, so a 200 there only means "uvicorn is up" — it says
nothing about whether the singleton scheduler task is still alive. If the
scheduler crashes, a static 200 lets every downstream gate (healthcheck,
deploy health-wait) treat a process doing zero background work as healthy.

So the probe is loop-liveness-aware: a role that STARTS a core loop it owns
(the proactive scheduler under ``start_schedulers`` — ``all`` / ``background``;
the world-event scheduler under ``start_world_event_scheduler``;
the durable coordinator/worker under ``run_background_coordinator`` /
``run_background_worker`` — ``all`` / ``background`` / the dedicated
``coordinator`` / ``worker`` roles), including the opt-in durable chat worker,
503s when that loop was started and its task
has since exited/crashed. Every non-started shape stays 200 to avoid false
negatives before boot: the ``api`` / ``connector`` roles (own no such loop),
bare containers (loops ``None``), and lifespan-not-run TestClients (the task was
never created).
