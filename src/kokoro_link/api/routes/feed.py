"""Character feed-wall HTTP routes.

Read paths (Phase 1):

* ``GET /api/v1/characters/{character_id}/feed`` — reverse-chronological
  list with cursor-based pagination via ``before`` (an ISO-8601
  timestamp). The ``limit`` query param is clamped server-side.
* ``GET /api/v1/feed/posts/{post_id}`` — single post lookup, used for
  permalinks / SSE follow-ups.

Manual post (Phase A4):

* ``POST /api/v1/characters/{character_id}/feed`` — operator-authored
  post that bypasses the daily-limit / cooldown gates. Flows through
  the same persist → SSE → memorialize pipeline as auto-composed posts.

Browse-trigger memorialize (Phase A close-out):

* ``POST /api/v1/characters/{character_id}/feed/seen`` — convert any
  unseen likes/comments since the last call into character memories.
  The chat-open path already calls this internally; this endpoint lets
  the frontend trigger it when the user only browses the feed without
  opening chat, so engagement still surfaces in the next conversation.

Read-receipt (KB11 of PLAYER_KNOWLEDGE_BOUNDARY_PLAN):

* ``POST /api/v1/characters/{character_id}/feed/viewed`` — idempotent
  batch: the frontend reports post ids the player has actually looked
  at (IntersectionObserver exposure, or a like/comment as fallback
  proof). This is the read-side foundation for KB8's disclosure
  ledger — a post's source ``private`` memory only flips to
  ``disclosed`` once the player demonstrably saw it, not merely once
  the character published it. This endpoint only records the fact.

Like paths (Phase A1):

* ``POST /api/v1/feed/posts/{post_id}/like`` — idempotent like.
* ``DELETE /api/v1/feed/posts/{post_id}/like`` — idempotent unlike.

Comment paths (Phase A2):

* ``GET /api/v1/feed/posts/{post_id}/comments`` — reverse-chronological
  list of comments.
* ``POST /api/v1/feed/posts/{post_id}/comments`` — author a comment.
* ``DELETE /api/v1/feed/comments/{comment_id}`` — delete own comment.

All write endpoints are single-user today: ``liker_id`` / ``author_id``
are stamped server-side so the frontend doesn't have to plumb identity.
When auth lands we'll switch to a request dependency that resolves the
caller; the service signatures already accept a kwarg.
