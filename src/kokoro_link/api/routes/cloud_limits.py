"""Player-facing hosted runtime-limit hints — cloud mode only.

Sibling of ``GET /cloud/credits`` and ``GET /cloud/pricing``: same
cloud-mode-only 404, same display-only contract. What it answers is "what
ceilings does this account have, and how much is spent" — the numbers the
hosted services already enforce (character slots, daily character creates,
daily 起幕 openings, per-session message cap, and the three capability
switches), so the SPA can warn *before* the player presses a button instead
of only reporting the refusal afterwards. NF4 adds the one entry that is not
a ceiling at all — ``background.dormancy_days``, the window after which the
characters stop running in the background — for the same reason: better said
in advance than discovered as an unexplained silence.

**Advisory only.** Nothing here grants or denies anything; the guards in
``character_service`` / ``story_scene_quota`` / the media services remain the
sole decision points. Accordingly the handler performs no write, and every
count is fail-soft: ``used`` may be ``null`` (with ``limit`` still present)
when a counter could not be read. A frontend that is unsure must not block —
see ``frontend/src/composables/useActionPricing.ts``.

Self-host never mounts this router (``app.py`` registers it only in cloud
mode) and the handler 404s anyway, so a self-host install's API inventory and
rendered UI are unchanged.
