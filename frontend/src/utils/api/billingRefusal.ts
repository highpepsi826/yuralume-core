/**
 * One place to ask "is this failure an *answer*?" — and one place to react.
 *
 * Under a hosted fixed-price tier every generation button can come back with
 * two refusals that are not faults at all:
 *
 *   - `402 insufficient_credits` — the wallet is empty. Nothing ran and
 *     nothing was charged, so the right surface is the shared top-up card,
 *     never a red error line that reads as "the generator is broken".
 *   - `409 price_changed` — the published price moved between the number this
 *     screen quoted and the charge. Nothing was reserved either, so the right
 *     surface is "prices moved, send it again".
 *
 * Each surface used to re-derive that pair with its own `if` ladder, which is
 * how `/images/candidates` ended up rendering a moved price as a generic
 * generation failure. The classification lives here so a new priced button
 * inherits it instead of re-inventing two thirds of it.
