/**
 * Hosted runtime limits for the player surfaces — one shared snapshot.
 *
 * The hosted account profile caps character slots, creations per rolling 24h,
 * scenes per rolling 24h and messages per session, and switches album / TTS /
 * video generation on or off. All of it is enforced server-side; this module
 * exists so a surface can *warn before* the click rather than surface an
 * error after it. NF4/NF5 add one entry that is not a ceiling —
 * `backgroundDormancyDays`, the window of player absence after which a
 * character's background life stops — carried for the same reason: better
 * said in advance than discovered as a silence with no explanation.
 *
 * Module-scope refs make it a de-facto singleton, matching `useCloudCredits`
 * and `useActionPricing`: a sidebar, a create modal and a card panel all
 * showing the same ceiling cost exactly one request.
 *
 * ## Three rules this module exists to keep
 *
 * 1. **Advisory only — counters never disable.** A rolling counter (slots,
 *    creations, scene openings) must leave its control pressable: the count
 *    decays the moment it is read (24h windows refill continuously), so a
 *    disable would outlive its own truth with no path back — the refresh
 *    triggers all live behind the very button it turned off. The one narrow
 *    exception is a *capability switch* (album / TTS) that a loaded snapshot
 *    explicitly turns off: that is a static fact about the plan, the server
 *    will always refuse, and hiding/disabling spares a guaranteed error. A
 *    wrong "no" costs a player something they were entitled to, which is
 *    strictly worse than a redundant error message.
 * 2. **Unknown is never "blocked", and never "off".** A limit is only
 *    reported as reached when a real `used` count is at or over a real
 *    `limit`. Feature switches read `true` unless a loaded snapshot says
 *    `false` — a failed read must not take the album away.
 * 3. **Self-host renders nothing.** Non-cloud deployments issue zero requests
 *    and report `supported === false`, so every consumer's `v-if` collapses
 *    and the DOM is byte-identical to before this feature existed.
 *
 * Like `useCloudCredits`, reads carry the generation they were issued under:
 * a response that lands after the identity changed belongs to a player who is
 * no longer signed in and is dropped whole.
