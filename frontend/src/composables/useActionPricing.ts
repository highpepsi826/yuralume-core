/**
 * Published action prices for the hosted player surfaces (plan AP2/AP3).
 *
 * One module-scope snapshot, shared by every surface that quotes a price —
 * the chat composer, the picture generator, the overage switches — so a
 * screen full of hints costs exactly one request. Same shape as
 * `useCloudCredits`, with a much calmer refresh policy: prices change when
 * the back office edits them, balances change on every action.
 *
 * ## Why a price can resolve to `null`
 *
 * The proxy publishes the whole tier table (it is public and identical for
 * everyone); nothing in the SPA knows which tier the signed-in player is on.
 * So a price is quotable only when it is unambiguous:
 *
 *   1. at least one tier bills `action_fixed` — under `token_floating` the
 *      fixed number is simply not what gets charged;
 *   2. every `action_fixed` tier publishes this action; and
 *   3. they all publish the same number.
 *
 * Anything else resolves to `null` and the hint stays hidden. The plan's red
 * line is "fail-soft, never a fabricated number" — quoting another tier's
 * price would be exactly that. See `resolveActionPrice` for the rule and the
 * report note about the backend adding the caller's own tier.
