/**
 * Hosted credit ("螢火") balance state for the player surfaces.
 *
 * Module-scope refs make this a de-facto singleton, matching `useAuth` —
 * the sidebar badge, the chat panel and the image panel all read and refresh
 * the same snapshot without pulling pinia in.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - `ensureLoaded()` on first mount of a cloud player surface.
 *   - `refreshAfterAction()` after a deliberate, charged player action
 *     (chat reply finished, image candidates returned, TTS audio obtained).
 *     Fire-and-forget: a balance read must never surface an error or block
 *     the action that just succeeded.
 *   - `reset()` whenever the authenticated identity changes — login, account
 *     switch, logout, or a token revoked underneath us. Driven by
 *     `onIdentityChanged` rather than by whichever component renders the
 *     logout button, so a shared browser never carries a balance across
 *     accounts on *any* of those paths.
 *
 * Because this is a singleton fed by an async read, clearing the refs is not
 * enough on its own: a request that was already in the air when the identity
 * changed would still resolve and write the previous player's balance back
 * in. Every read therefore carries the `generation` it was issued under and
 * is discarded on arrival if `reset()` has bumped it since.
 *
 * Fail-soft (plan §1-4): a `404` means there is no ledger at all and the
 * badge hides for good; any other failure keeps the last-known-good value on
 * screen. The badge never renders a fabricated zero.
 *
 * Self-host never issues a request at all — see `isCloudDeployment`, which is
 * checked inside `load()` rather than at each of the dozen post-action call
 * sites.
